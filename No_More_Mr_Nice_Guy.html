<br>making others happy. Nice Guys avoid conflict like the plague and will go to great lengths to avoid 
<br>upsetting anyone. In general, Nice Guys are peaceful and generous. Nice Guys are especially concerned 
<br>about pleasing women and being different from other men. In a nutshell, </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys believe that if they

<br>practice as a psychotherapist. These passively pleasing men struggle in vain to experience the happiness 
<br>they so desperately crave and believe they deserve. This frustration is due to the fact that </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys 
<br>have believed a myth.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">belief that if Nice Guys are &quot;good,&quot; they will be loved, get their needs met, and live a problem-free life. 
<br>When this life strategy fails to produce the desired results â as it often does â Nice Guys usually just 
<br>try harder, doing more of the same. Due to the sense of helplessness and resentment this pattern 
<br>inevitably produces, Nice Guys are often anything but nice.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:4055px; width:588px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The concept of the Nice Guy Syndrome grew out of my own frustration of trying to do it &quot;right,&quot; yet

<br>introduction. Jason described his life as &quot;perfect&quot; â except for one major problem â his sex life. It had 
<br>been several months since he and his wife Heather had been sexual and it didn&#x27;t look like anything was 
<br>going to change soon.

<br>prided himself on not having many ups and downs and for never losing his temper. He revealed that he 
<br>liked to make people happy and that he hated conflict. To avoid rocking the boat with his wife, he 
<br>tended to hold back his feelings and tried to do everything &quot;right.&quot;

While doing 
<br>so, he stated that he had written a few things down so he wouldn&#x27;t forget them.

<br>finds something wrong. I don&#x27;t deserve to be treated this way. I try to be a good husband and father, but 
<br>it&#x27;s never good enough.&quot;

<br>baby Chelsie up, fed her breakfast, gave her a bath. I had her all ready to go and was about to get ready 
<br>myself. Then Heather walked in and got that look on her face. I knew I was in trouble.&quot;

That&#x27;s a </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">good</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> outfit.&#x27;&quot; Jason mimicked his wife&#x27;s tone. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know she 
<br>wanted Chelsie to wear something different. After everything I did to get her ready this morning, it was 
<br>still wrong.&quot;

<br>I loaded the dishwasher, did the pots and pans, and swept the floor. I thought Heather would really 
<br>appreciate all that I was doing to help out. Before I was finished, she walked in and asked, &#x27;How come

<br>married because we&#x27;re both Christians. Sex is real important to me, but Heather just isn&#x27;t interested. I 
<br>thought once you got married, everything was supposed to be great. After all I do for Heather, you&#x27;d 
<br>think she be willing to give me the one thing I really want.&quot;

It seems like I&#x27;m always giving so much more than I get.&quot; Now, looking

<br>to ask?&quot;

<br>Since Omar sees himself as such a giver, he can&#x27;t understand these accusations. Omar states that his

He believes these traits set him apart

<br>The women he knows tell him what a great listener he is and often call him to share their problems. He 
<br>likes feeling needed. These female friends constantly tell him what a great &quot;catch&quot; he will make for 
<br>some lucky woman. In spite of the way he treats women, he can&#x27;t understand why they all seem to be 
<br>attracted to jerks, rather than Nice Guys like him.

These traits are the result of a 
<br>script, often formed in childhood, that guides their lives. While other men may have one or two of these 
<br>traits, Nice Guys seem to possess a significant number. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:9071px; width:580px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are givers</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Nice Guys frequently state that it makes them feel good to give to others. These 
<br>men believe their generosity is a sign of how good they are and will make other people love and 
<br>appreciate them.

If a person has a problem, has a need, is angry, depressed or sad, Nice 
<br>Guys will frequently attempt to solve or fix the situation (usually without being asked).

A universal trait of the Nice Guy Syndrome is the seeking of 
<br>validation from others. Everything a Nice Guy does or says is at some level calculated to gain someone&#x27;s

Nice Guys seek to keep their world smooth. To do this, they avoid doing 
<br>things that might rock the boat or upset anyone.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:9427px; width:559px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys believe they must hide their perceived flaws and mistakes</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. These men are afraid that 
<br>others will get mad at them, shame them, or leave them if some mistake or shortcoming is exposed.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:9480px; width:566px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys seek the &quot;right&quot; way to do things</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Nice Guys believe there is a key to having a happy, 
<br>problem-free life. They are convinced that if they can only figure out the right way to do everything, 
<br>nothing should ever go wrong.

Nice Guys tend to analyze rather than feel. They may see feelings as 
<br>a waste of time and energy. They frequently try to keep their feelings on an even keel.

Many Nice Guys report having unavailable, 
<br>absent, passive, angry, philandering, or alcoholic fathers. It is not unusual for these men to make a 
<br>decision at some point in their lives to try to be 180 degrees different from Dad.

<br>conditioning, many Nice Guys have few male friends. Nice Guys frequently seek the approval of women 
<br>and convince themselves they are different from other men. They like to believe that they are not selfish, 
<br>angry, or abusive â traits they link to &quot;other&quot; men.

These men often feel that it is selfish to put 
<br>their needs first. They believe it is a virtue to put others&#x27; needs ahead of their own.

<br>only happy if their partner is happy. Therefore they will often focus tremendous energy on their intimate 
<br>relationships.

After all, how can being nice 
<br>be such a bad thing? We might even chuckle at the Marvin Milquetoast behaviors of these men as 
<br>portrayed in comic strips and television sitcoms. Since men already represent an easy target in our 
<br>culture, the caricature of a sensitive guy might be an object of amusement rather than concern.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10012px; width:589px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Nice Guys themselves frequently have a difficult time grasping the depth and seriousness of their beliefs

<br>core belief system about themselves and the world around them. These men have been conditioned to 
<br>believe that if they are &quot;nice,&quot; they will be loved, get their needs met, and have a smooth life.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10286px; width:561px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The term Nice Guy is actually a misnomer because Nice Guys are often anything but nice. Here are 
<br>some Not-So-Nice Traits of Nice Guys:
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10338px; width:565px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are dishonest</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. These men hide their mistakes, avoid conflict, say what they think people 
<br>want to hear, and repress their feelings. These traits make Nice Guys fundamentally dishonest.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10391px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are secretive.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Because they are so driven to seek approval, Nice Guys will hide anything that 
<br>they believe might upset anyone. The Nice Guy motto is, &quot;If at first you don&#x27;t succeed, hide the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">evidence.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10460px; width:583px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are compartmentalized.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Nice Guys are adept at harmonizing contradictory pieces of 
<br>information about themselves by separating them into individual compartments in their minds. 
<br>Therefore, a married man can create his own definition of fidelity which allows him to deny that he had 
<br>an affair with his secretary (or intern) because he never put his penis in her vagina.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10547px; width:590px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are manipulative</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Nice Guys tend to have a hard time making their needs a priority and 
<br>have difficulty asking for what they want in clear and direct ways. This creates a sense of powerlessness. 
<br>Therefore, they frequently resort to manipulation when trying to get their needs met.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10616px; width:582px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are controlling</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. A major priority for Nice Guys is keeping their world smooth. This creates 
<br>a constant need to try to control the people and things around them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10669px; width:550px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> </span><span style="font-family: Times-BoldItalic; font-size:14px">give to get</span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px"> </span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Though Nice Guys tend to be generous givers, their giving often has 
<br>unconscious and unspoken strings attached. They want to be appreciated, they want some kind of 
<br>reciprocation, they want someone to stop being angry at them, etc. Nice Guys often report feeling 
<br>frustrated or resentful as a result of giving so much while seemingly getting so little in return.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10755px; width:574px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are passive-aggressive</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Nice Guys tend to express their frustration and resentment in 
<br>indirect, roundabout, and not so nice ways. This includes being unavailable, forgetting, being late, not 
<br>following through, not being able to get an erection, climaxing too quickly, and repeating the same 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:13px">annoying behaviors even when they have promised to never do them again.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10841px; width:579px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are full of rage</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Though Nice Guys frequently deny ever getting angry, a lifetime of 
<br>frustration and resentment creates a pressure cooker of repressed rage deep inside these men. This rage 
<br>tends to erupt at some of the most unexpected and seemingly inappropriate times.

Addictive behavior serves the purpose of relieving stress, altering moods, or 
<br>medicating pain. Since Nice Guys tend to keep so much bottled up inside, it has to come out somewhere. 
<br>One of the most common addictive behaviors for Nice Guys is sexual compulsiveness.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:11092px; width:580px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys have difficulty setting boundaries</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Many Nice Guys have a hard time saying &quot;no,&quot; &quot;stop,&quot; 
<br>or &quot;I&#x27;m going to.&quot; They often feel like helpless victims and see the other person as the cause of the 
<br>problems they are experiencing.

Though Nice Guys desire to be liked and loved, their behaviors 
<br>actually make it difficult for people to get very close to them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:11214px; width:570px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are often attracted to people and situations that need fixing.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> This behavior is often the 
<br>result of the Nice Guy&#x27;s childhood conditioning, his need to look good, or his quest for approval. 
<br>Unfortunately, this tendency pretty much guarantees that Nice Guys will spend most of their time 
<br>putting out fires and managing crises.

<br>tremendous emphasis on this part of their lives, their intimate relationships are frequently a source of 
<br>struggle and frustration. For example:

<br>Guys tend to blame their partner for standing in the way of their happiness.

Though most Nice Guys deny having problems with sex, I have 
<br>yet to meet one who isn&#x27;t either dissatisfied with his sex life, has a sexual dysfunction (can&#x27;t get or 
<br>maintain an erection, climaxes too quickly), or has sexually acted out (through affairs, prostitution, 
<br>pornography, compulsive masturbation, etc.).

The majority of Nice Guys I&#x27;ve met have been 
<br>talented, intelligent, and moderately successful. Almost without exception though, they fail to live up to 
<br>their full potential.

He&#x27;ll do all the extra little things like 
<br>picking up the kids and fixing dinner when I have to put in extra hours at work. But then out of the blue, 
<br>he&#x27;ll throw a tantrum about me never being sexually available to him.&quot;

But they don&#x27;t know what he 
<br>can really be like. He&#x27;s always helping people out with their car or something else that needs fixing. 
<br>When I ask him to do something he tells me that he can never make me happy and that I&#x27;m nagging and 
<br>controlling like his mother.&quot;

He will do anything for me except really be there for me. He&#x27;ll go 
<br>shopping with me even though I know he doesn&#x27;t want to. The whole time he will just sulk, which makes 
<br>me miserable. I wish he would just tell me &#x27;no&#x27; sometimes.&quot;

He&#x27;ll just keep it in and it will build like a 
<br>pressure cooker. I won&#x27;t have a clue that anything is bothering him. And then out of the blue, he&#x27;ll 
<br>explode and we&#x27;ll end up in a big fight. If he would just tell me when he is upset about something, it 
<br>would make it a lot easier.&quot;

He thinks that if I just 
<br>did everything his way, it would solve all my problems. He always tells me I dwell on the negative and 
<br>that he can never make me happy. All I really want is for him to listen to me.&quot;

<br>harder to be a good man. Breaking free from the Nice Guy Syndrome demands embracing a totally 
<br>different way of viewing oneself and the world, a complete change in one&#x27;s personal paradigm. Let me 
<br>explain.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:13306px; width:71px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica-Bold; font-size:14px">Paradigms

Everyone uses these road maps and 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">everyone assumes the map they are using is up-to-date and accurate.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:13394px; width:577px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Paradigms often operate at an unconscious level, yet they determine to a large degree our attitudes and 
<br>behaviors. They serve as a filter through which we process life experiences. Data that does not fit our

<br>magnified by the process, and adds even greater support for that particular way of believing.

Unfortunately, if 
<br>they are outdated or inaccurate, they can send us in the wrong direction or fruitlessly driving around the 
<br>same old neighborhood. When this happens we often keep trying harder to find our desired destination 
<br>while feeling more and more frustrated. Even though an individual following an inaccurate or outdated 
<br>paradigm may think his behavior makes perfect sense, those around him may wonder what he could 
<br>possibly be thinking to make him act the way he does.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:13721px; width:586px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Most paradigms are developed when we are young, naÃ¯ve, and relatively powerless. They are often 
<br>based on the inaccurate interpretations of childhood experiences. Since they are often unconscious, they 
<br>are rarely evaluated or updated. Perhaps most significantly, they are assumed to be 100 percent accurate 
<br>â even when they are not.

<br>challenged. Their inclination is to hang on to belief systems that have proven to be consistently 
<br>unworkable, yet are so embedded in their unconscious mind that to challenge them is tantamount to 
<br>heresy. It is difficult for Nice Guys to consider doing something different, even when what they are 
<br>doing isn&#x27;t working.

<br>is a good example of the frustration that can result from an ineffective Nice Guy paradigm. Jason had a 
<br>controlling, perfectionist father who put unrealistic demands on Jason and his siblings. His father 
<br>believed there was one right way to do everything â his way. Jason&#x27;s mother was an emotionally 
<br>dependent woman who lived through her children. When his mother was needy, she would smother her 
<br>kids. When the children had needs, she was often too emotionally distressed to respond.

<br>up his father&#x27;s expectations. Similarly, no matter how giving he was, his needy mother would never be 
<br>available to nurture him. He could not see that there really was no way to do everything right. And 
<br>regardless of how well he believed he hid his flaws or mistakes, people might still get angry at him.

<br>see was to just keep trying harder doing more of the same. The only thing his paradigm ever really did 
<br>was to create a distraction from his feelings of fear, worthlessness, and inadequacy.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:14632px; width:583px; height:148px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In adulthood, Jason tried to apply his childhood paradigm to his relationship with his wife. Like his 
<br>mother, his wife was only attentive when she was emotionally needy. Like his father, she could be 
<br>critical and controlling. By applying his childhood road map to his marriage â trying to do everything 
<br>right, being attentive and nurturing, never being a moment&#x27;s problem, hiding his mistakes â Jason 
<br>created an illusion that he could get his wife to approve of him all the time, be sexually available 
<br>whenever he wanted, and never get mad at him. His defective paradigm prevented him from seeing that 
<br>no matter what he did, his wife would still at times be cold, critical, and unavailable, </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">and</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> that maybe he 
<br>needed her to be that way. Even when his paradigm was just as ineffective in adulthood as it was in 
<br>childhood, Jason&#x27;s only option seemed to be to just keep trying harder.

They have a difficult time asking for 
<br>help and try to hide any signs of imperfection or weakness. Breaking free from the Nice Guy Syndrome 
<br>involves reversing this pattern.

<br>from safe people. It is essential, therefore, that men who want to break free from the Nice Guy 
<br>Syndrome find safe people to assist them in this process.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">

<br>religious leader, or close friend. Since Nice Guys tend to seek out the approval of women, I strongly 
<br>encourage them to begin this process with men. For some Nice Guys, the concept of &quot;safe men&quot; may 
<br>seem like an oxymoron, but I highly recommend it anyway.

Some of the most 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">significant aspects of my own recovery from the Nice Guy Syndrome (even before I knew what it was) 
<br>occurred in the context of 12-step groups and therapy groups. Even though I am sure it is possible to 
<br>break free from the Nice Guy Syndrome without the help of a group, it is the most effective tool I know 
<br>for facilitating the recovery process.

<br>The first is that the program of recovery presented in </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">No More Mr. Nice Guy!</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> is not just a few good 
<br>ideas to try on for size. It represents a challenge to everything Nice Guys believe about what they must 
<br>do to be loved, get their needs met, and keep their world calm.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:16641px; width:590px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Breaking free from the Nice Guy Syndrome involves a radical change in perspective and behavior. 
<br>Trying to do it halfway will only result in needless suffering.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:16694px; width:586px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Second, breaking free from the Nice Guy syndrome will significantly effect your personal relationships. 
<br>If you are currently in a relationship, I encourage you to ask your partner to read this book along with 
<br>you. The program of recovery presented in </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">No More Mr. Nice Guy!</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> will significantly affect not only 
<br>you, but also those closest to you. Though your partner may be supportive of you making positive 
<br>changes, they may also initially frighten him or her. Reading this book together can help facilitate this 
<br>transition.

<br>answer to this question that makes sense: </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Because it does not feel safe or acceptable for a boy or man 
<br>to be just who he is.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Becoming a Nice Guy is a way of coping with situations where it does not feel safe 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">or acceptable for a boy or man to be just who he is. Further, the only thing that would make a child or an 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">adult sacrifice one&#x27;s self by trying to become something different is a belief that being just who he is 
<br>must be a bad and/or dangerous thing.

<br>their families and the world around them that it was not safe, acceptable, or desirable for them to be who 
<br>they were, just as they were.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:18982px; width:573px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">So how did Nice Guys receive these messages and why did they respond to them in the way that they 
<br>did? The following is a short course on how families and society turn perfect little boys into men who 
<br>believe they have to be &quot;good&quot; in order to be loved.

In these first few 
<br>years a child&#x27;s personality is most significantly influenced by his surroundings. It is during this time that 
<br>his paradigms begin to be established. Since the strongest influences during this time are usually a 
<br>child&#x27;s parents and extended family, this is where we must begin our examination of the origins of the 
<br>Nice Guy Syndrome.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:19200px; width:585px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">There are two important facts we must understand about children. First, when children come into the 
<br>world they are </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">totally helpless</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. They are dependent on others to recognize and respond to their needs in 
<br>a timely, judicious manner. As a result of this dependency, every child&#x27;s greatest fear is abandonment. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">To children, abandonment means death.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:19287px; width:567px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Second, children are </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">ego-centered</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. This means that they inherently believe they are the center of the 
<br>universe and everything revolves around them. Therefore, they believe that they are the </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">cause</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> of

<br>dynamic for all children. </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Whenever a child experiences any kind of abandonment he will always 
<br>believe that he is the cause of what has happened to him.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> These abandonment experiences might 
<br>include any of the following experiences:

<br>attract his parent&#x27;s attention in a negative way. Even though it may seem illogical for a child to do 
<br>something that invites painful or negative attention, the consequences of the behavior may not feel as 
<br>bad as feeling lonely or isolated.

<br>result of their internalized toxic shame, each developed a life paradigm that involved seeking approval 
<br>and hiding perceived flaws. All of these men believed that these life strategies were necessary if they 
<br>were to have any hope of being loved, getting their needs met, and having a problem-free life.

<br>Nice Guy described in this book. The progression from perfect little boy to Nice Guy basically occurs in 
<br>three stages: </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">Abandonment, internalization of toxic shame</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">, and </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">the creation of survival mechanisms</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">.

They were valued for always doing it &quot;right&quot; 
<br>and never being a problem. This communicated that they were only lovable when they lived up to their

<br>overwhelmed, or distracted to provide a nurturing environment for their child. At times, these messages

<br>all Nice Guys developed survival mechanisms to help them do three very important things:
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:25403px; width:458px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">1) Try to cope with the pain and terror caused by their abandonment experiences.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:35px; top:25546px; width:433px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: ZapfDingbats; font-size:7px">l</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:7px">     </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">IF I can hide my flaws and become what I think others want me to be</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">

<br>lives. Even though it is based on faulty interpretations of childhood events, it is the only road map these 
<br>men have. Nice Guys believe this map is accurate, and if they follow it correctly, they should arrive at 
<br>their desired location â a smooth, happy life. </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Even though this life script is often highly ineffective, 
<br>Nice Guys frequently just keep trying harder, doing more of the same, hoping for different results.

<br>internalized toxic shame are usually manifested in one of two ways. In one form, a Nice Guy 
<br>exaggerates his belief about his &quot;not OK-ness&quot; and believes he is the worst kind of person. I call this 
<br>man the </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">&quot;I&#x27;m so bad&quot;</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Nice Guy.

He can give concrete examples 
<br>of bad behavior in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood that support his core belief about himself. He 
<br>can tell of breaking windows and getting whippings as a little boy. He will reveal running afoul of the 
<br>law and making his mother cry when he was a teenager. He will tell tales of smoking, drinking, using 
<br>drugs and carousing as an adult. He is convinced his only hope for having any kind of happiness in life 
<br>lies in trying his best to mask his inherent badness. He never really believes anyone will buy into his 
<br>Nice Guy persona, but doesn&#x27;t think he has any other choice.

This man handles his toxic shame by 
<br>repressing his core belief about his worthlessness. He believes he is one of the nicest guys you will ever 
<br>meet. If he is conscious of any perceived flaws, they are seen as minor and easily correctable. As a child 
<br>he was never a moment&#x27;s problem. As a teen he did everything right. As an adult, he follows all the rules 
<br>to a &quot;t&quot;. This Nice Guy has tucked his core belief about his &quot;not OK-ness&quot; into a handy, air-tight

<br>both operate from the same life paradigm. All Nice Guys believe they are not OK just as they are, and 
<br>therefore must hide their flaws and become what they believe other people want them to be.

Neither is 
<br>as bad or good as they believe themselves to be. They are both just wounded souls operating from a 
<br>belief system based on the inaccurate perceptions of the events of their childhood.

These social 
<br>changes created three profound dynamics that contributed to the wide spread phenomena of the Nice 
<br>Guy Syndrome in the baby boom generation.

<br>school system dominated by women. As a result, men became comfortable being defined by women and 
<br>became dependent on the approval of women.

<br>feminism furthered the belief of many men that if they wanted to be loved and get their needs met, they 
<br>had to become what they believed women wanted them to be. For many men, this meant trying to hide 
<br>any traits that might cause them to be labeled as &quot;bad&quot; men.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:27898px; width:583px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The shift to a manufacturing society and an urban migration in the post-war years took fathers away 
<br>from their sons in droves. According to the US census, in 1910 one-third of all families lived on farms. 
<br>By 1940, this number had shrunk to one in five. By 1970, 96 percent of all families lived in urban areas.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:27968px; width:589px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In an agrarian society, boys connected with their fathers by working alongside them in the fields. This 
<br>often meant contact with extended family that included grandfathers, uncles, and cousins. This daily 
<br>contact with men provided boys with an intimate model of maleness. Sons learned about being male by 
<br>watching their dads, just as their own fathers had learned by watching their fathers. As families migrated 
<br>from rural areas to cities and suburbs after World War II, the contact between fathers and sons 
<br>diminished significantly. Dads left home in the morning and went to work. Most sons never got to see 
<br>what their fathers did, let alone have much time to spend with them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:28104px; width:588px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Fathers became unavailable in other ways. Men&#x27;s addictions to work, TV, alcohol, and sex took them 
<br>away from their sons. Increases in divorce began to separate boys from their fathers. Census statistics 
<br>show that the incidence of divorce among men tripled from 1940 to 1970. In 1940, just over five million 
<br>households were headed by women. By 1970, this figure had almost tripled to over 13 million 
<br>households.

<br>relationship with their fathers in childhood.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Sometimes this was a result of their fathers working long 
<br>hours, being withdrawn, or being passive. More often than not, Nice Guys describe their fathers in 
<br>negative terms. They often see them as controlling, rageful, angry, absent, abusive, unavailable, 
<br>addictive, or philandering. </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">It is not unusual at some point in childhood for Nice Guys to have made 
<br>a conscious decision to be different from their fathers.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:28327px; width:577px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The unavailability of dads during this era often required mothers to take over the job of the fathers. 
<br>Women inherited the defacto job of turning boys into men. Unfortunately even the most well-meaning 
<br>mothers are not equipped to teach their sons how to be men by themselves. This hasn&#x27;t kept them from 
<br>trying.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:28413px; width:583px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">I believe the significant number of Nice Guys produced in the &#x27;40s, &#x27;50s, and &#x27;60s is the direct 
<br>result of mothers, not fathers, teaching their sons how to be male.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Consequently, many Nice Guys 
<br>have adopted a female perspective of masculinity and are comfortable having their manhood 
<br>defined by women.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">

<br>Since World War II, boys have entered schools dominated by females. For most boys, the first several 
<br>years in school become basic training in how to please women. From kindergarten through sixth grade, I

In the primary grades, they make up only 15% of 
<br>the teaching staff, and that number is steadily dropping. From daycare to preschool to elementary 
<br>school, little boys in the post-war era have been surrounded by women. There have been few adult males 
<br>to help them through this experience. If a little boy was already disconnected from his father and trained 
<br>to please a woman, the typical school system magnified this conditioning.

<br>their fathers. Battle lines were drawn between young men protesting a war started and perpetuated by 
<br>their fathers. A generation of World War II veterans could not understand the flaunting of responsibility 
<br>and the social rebellion of their sons. The young men of this generation became the antithesis of their 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">fathers and of an establishment that solved domestic and international problems with guns and bombs. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The anti-war movement created a new breed of males focused on love, peace, and avoiding conflict.

<br>control provided new freedom, and women&#x27;s liberation was in its infancy. Some mothers during the 
<br>Baby Boom era could foresee a change in gender roles on the horizon. They worked to prepare their 
<br>sons and daughters for what was to come. Many of these mothers raised their daughters to not need a 
<br>man. At the same time, they trained their sons to be different from their fathers â peaceful, giving, 
<br>nurturing, and attentive to a woman&#x27;s needs.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:29176px; width:587px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Radical feminism in the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s projected an angry generalization about men. Some feminists 
<br>claimed that men were the cause all of the problems in the world. Others asserted that men were merely 
<br>an unnecessary nuisance. More than likely, the majority of women during this era did not feel this way 
<br>about men. Nevertheless, enough angry women were significantly vocal to contribute to a social climate 
<br>that convinced many men that it was not OK to be just who they were. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:29279px; width:591px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Epitaphs like &quot;men are pigs&quot; and &quot;all men are rapists&quot; were prominent during this time. Less angry 
<br>slogans of feminism asserted that &quot;a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle.&quot; Men who were 
<br>already conditioned to look to women for definition and approval were especially susceptible to these 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:13px">kinds of messages. This added incentive for these men to try to figure out what women wanted and try to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">become that in order to be loved and get their needs met.

<br>of these men are not happy. You quickly notice the lack of energy in them. They are life-preserving but 
<br>not exactly life-giving. Ironically, you often see these men with strong women who positively radiate 
<br>energy. Here we have a finely-tuned young man, ecologically superior to his father, sympathetic to the

<br>decades have changed roles of men and women. &quot;The hard-driving woman has to switch personae when 
<br>she gets home. She&#x27;s got to throttle back, or she&#x27;ll castrate everything in the domestic niche. Many white, 
<br>middle-class women have dodged this dilemma by finding themselves a nice, malleable boy-man who 
<br>becomes another son in the subliminally matriarchal household.&quot; (&quot;Politically Incorrect Desires,&quot; Salon:

<br>unique combination of social events in the post-World War II era reinforced and magnified the messages 
<br>that many little boys had already received from their families â that they weren&#x27;t OK just as they were. 
<br>These social events further amplified the belief that if they wanted to be loved, get their needs met, and 
<br>have a smooth life, they had to hide their flaws and become what others (especially women) wanted 
<br>them to be.

<br>with the Baby-Boom generation. I am seeing more and more young men in their twenties, and even 
<br>teens, who demonstrate all of the characteristics of the Nice Guy Syndrome. Not only have these young 
<br>men been effected by all of the social dynamics listed above, even more grew up in single parent 
<br>families or were raised by Nice Guy fathers. As I write this, I expect that we are just beginning on our 
<br>third generation of Nice Guys.

<br>Being a Nice Guy is the ultimate attachment for these men. They genuinely believe their commitment to

From the 
<br>moment he begins to dress her he is unconsciously attaching his value and identity to the 
<br>acknowledgment he thinks he will receive from being a &quot;good dad.&quot; He knows that when he takes his 
<br>daughter walking people will look at her and smile. Some will comment about the cute little girl and her 
<br>father out for a walk. A few will stop and ask her age and others will gush about what a precious little 
<br>angel she is. This attention makes Cal feel good about himself.

Further, his dependency on external 
<br>validation actually prevents people from getting to know him just as he is. None of these things have 
<br>anything to do with who he is as a person. Nevertheless, they are the things he believes give him identity 
<br>and value.

<br>most pronounced in their relationships with women. Nice Guys interpret a woman&#x27;s approval as the 
<br>ultimate validation of their worth. Signs of a woman&#x27;s approval can take the form of her desire to have 
<br>sex, flirtatious behavior, a smile, a touch, or attentiveness. At the other end of the spectrum, if a woman 
<br>is depressed, in a bad mood, or angry, Nice Guys interpret these things to mean that she is not accepting 
<br>or approving of them.

<br>woman&#x27;s sexual availability. Since Nice Guys see sex as the ultimate form of acceptance, and they 
<br>believe a woman must be in a good mood before she will have sex, these men are constantly diligent to 
<br>not do anything that might upset a woman whom they desire. In addition, if a woman they desire is 
<br>angry, depressed, or in a bad mood, they believe they must do something quickly â lie, offer solutions, 
<br>sacrifice self, manipulate â to fix it.

Since Nice Guys have been conditioned by their 
<br>families and society to never do anything to upset a woman, they are hyper-vigilant in responding to the 
<br>moods and desires of women they don&#x27;t even plan on having sex with.

<br>doing OK, so is he. If she is angry, depressed, or stressed, he will feel anxious until she is fixed. This 
<br>connection runs so deep that many Nice Guys have told me that they feel guilty if they are in a good

<br>Even if the Nice Guy argues with the woman&#x27;s evaluation, at some level he knows that since she is the 
<br>woman, she must be right. (One Nice Guy asked me, &quot;If a man is talking in the forest and no woman is 
<br>there to hear him, is he still wrong?&quot;)

<br>women, the truth is, most of these men have tremendous rage toward women. This is because we tend to 
<br>eventually despise whatever we make into our god. When our god fails to respond in the ways we 
<br>expect, we humans tend to respond in one of two ways. We either blindly intensify our acts of worship 
<br>or lash out in righteous anger. When Nice Guys put a woman or women on a pedestal and attempt to win 
<br>their approval, sooner or later, this adoration will turn to rage when these objects of worship fail to live 
<br>up to the Nice Guys&#x27; expectations. This is why it is not unusual to hear a Nice Guy proclaim his undying 
<br>love to a woman in one breath and then ragefully call her a &quot;f . . . c . . .&quot; only moments later.

<br>approval. As long as the gay Nice Guy can convince himself that he is not sexually attracted to women, 
<br>he can delude himself into thinking that women don&#x27;t have any power over him.

One way to begin this process is 
<br>to pay attention when trying to impress or get approval. Recovering Nice Guys can observe themselves

<br>approval, they turn inward. In doing so, they can begin asking themselves the important questions:

<br>things he used to get approval from others. The next week he brought in a two-page list. I encouraged

<br>he occasionally heard a little voice that said he wasn&#x27;t worth it, doing so was one of the most affirming

<br>When alone, Nice Guys can discover who they are, what they like about themselves, and what rules they 
<br>choose to govern their lives. I strongly recommend that Nice Guys take trips and retreats by themselves 
<br>to places where no one knows them. In this context, the Nice Guy has fewer reasons to try to win 
<br>people&#x27;s approval, and there is less of a need to try to hide faults and mistakes. While alone, Nice Guys 
<br>can reflect on themselves and their life direction. It is also a good time to practice taking responsibility 
<br>for one&#x27;s needs.

He 
<br>will go to bed and get up when he wants. He will decide when and what to eat. He will decide where he 
<br>goes and what he does. When alone he will be less likely to caretake, seek approval, sacrifice self, or try 
<br>to fix someone&#x27;s problems.

<br>loneliness and isolation. When the Nice Guy discovers that spending time alone doesn&#x27;t kill him, he may 
<br>also realize that he doesn&#x27;t have to stay in bad relationships, tolerate intolerable behavior, or manipulate 
<br>people to try to get his needs met.

<br>with addictive patterns such as keeping busy, or using sex, food, or alcohol to medicate. Writing in a 
<br>journal during these times can be especially effective. Some of the most insightful periods I have 
<br>experienced in life have been by myself on weekend camping trips, week-long retreats, and times when 
<br>my wife has been out of town.

<br>and unlovable. Changing this core belief requires that they bring their humanity out into the open,

<br>By necessity, this process requires a safe person or safe people.

I suggest that the recovering Nice Guy set a regular time to meet 
<br>with his safe person or group, and a little at a time, start revealing himself. This process begins by just 
<br>talking about himself. This in itself makes many Nice Guys uncomfortable. Over time, the recovering 
<br>Nice Guy can begin revealing the things about himself that he is the least comfortable letting others see. 
<br>Once trust has been established, he can begin to reveal things about himself that create fear and shame. I 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">have watched many Nice Guys go from being secretive and evasive to revealing their deepest, darkest 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">secrets in the presence of safe people.

<br>minutes. Reid&#x27;s pattern in the group was to either join in actively or stay withdrawn. His quiet periods 
<br>were often a signal that he was emotionally distraught. When an opportune time arose, I told Reid that 
<br>he seemed withdrawn and I asked how he was doing.

<br>almost didn&#x27;t come tonight.&quot; He whispered softly as he looked down at his hands. &quot;In fact, I was thinking 
<br>about quitting the group.&quot;

<br>all of you.&quot;

<br>against him. One of the group members asked if he was having an affair.

<br>it.&quot;

I was so depressed 
<br>that I went out and bought a fifth of Vodka and got drunk. I&#x27;ve been on a binge ever since and I just can&#x27;t 
<br>make myself stop.&quot;

<br>again. He had been clean and sober since joining the group six months earlier. He was active in AA, but 
<br>had experienced a number of slips and relapses in his 12 years of recovery. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:43193px; width:566px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">A group member handed him a box of tissues and Reid wiped his eyes. He then continued telling his 
<br>story and revealing his shame in between sobs.

He shook his head and shared 
<br>that he had slipped so many times that he didn&#x27;t think anyone would care or want him back.

<br>judgment of him. They could see that he was hurting. They told him that they had great respect that he 
<br>came into group and revealed what was going on, especially since he had so much shame about it.

There&#x27;s more.&quot; He began to sob once again. Lifting 
<br>his hand to his forehead he shook his head as in disgust for himself.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:43456px; width:581px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;It gets worse. I went to the peep shows near my work two times this week.&quot; He turned his eyes to the 
<br>floor and wept almost uncontrollably. &quot;I had been doing so good.&quot; he choked out between sobs, &quot;Now 
<br>I&#x27;ve blown it all. I feel totally worthless and don&#x27;t want to go on living. I&#x27;ve made a mess of everything.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:43526px; width:577px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">For the rest of the hour, the group supported Reid and encouraged him to go all the way through his 
<br>shame. They reassured him that he wasn&#x27;t bad and that no one had judgment of him. To the contrary, 
<br>everyone respected him for revealing his shame and pain. They supported him in talking to his wife, 
<br>calling his sponsor and going to a meeting. They asked him to call one group member each day during 
<br>the next week and let them know how he was doing.

He had also released a heavy 
<br>burden and received the support of a group of people who genuinely cared about him and wanted him to 
<br>be OK. No matter how deeply Reid feared that his badness would cause people to judge him and 
<br>abandon him, neither of these things happened. Instead, he received the message that there was nothing 
<br>he could do that would make the men in the group stop liking him or stop caring about him.

<br>reality that they are human. Like every other human, Nice Guys make mistakes, use poor judgment, and 
<br>act inappropriately. Nevertheless, their humanity doesn&#x27;t make them bad or unlovable nor does it cause 
<br>other people to stop loving them.

<br>individuals who have some substance and sense of self. Chameleons usually don&#x27;t draw much of a crowd 
<br>or get many ovations.

<br>experience the intimacy and connection they have always desired. By learning to approve of themselves, 
<br>they begin to radiate a life energy and charisma that draws people to them. As Nice Guys stop seeking 
<br>approval and stop trying to hide their perceived flaws, they open a door to start getting what they really 
<br>want in love and life.

Lars had 
<br>come to see me on the encouragement of his wife. He reported being generally depressed and unhappy 
<br>for as long as he could remember. In recent months he had found it difficult to sleep at night and was 
<br>experiencing migraine headaches on a regular basis. Even though everything in his life seemed to be 
<br>&quot;fine&quot; â good job, nice home, family, etc. â he never seemed to be happy.

<br>disappearing to somewhere else in the world. These thoughts made him feel guilty, so he kept them to 
<br>himself.

<br>responsibility for finding ways to meet them. This discussion was met with both fear and resistance from 
<br>Lars. The same hesitancy was repeated as he began his second counseling session.

Nice Guys generally focus their attention 
<br>on meeting everyone else&#x27;s needs while trying to be &quot;low maintenance&quot; kinds of guys themselves. When 
<br>I talk with them about making their needs a priority, their response is similar to that of Lars.

When a child&#x27;s needs 
<br>are not met in a timely, healthy manner, the child may come to believe he is &quot;bad&quot; for having needs. He 
<br>may also think that it is his needs that cause people to hurt him or abandon him. Typically Nice Guys 
<br>respond to these inaccurate interpretations of their life events by developing a number of survival

<br>would abandon them. They also convinced themselves that if they didn&#x27;t have needs, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt so

<br>also that their very survival seemed to depend on appearing not to have needs.

<br>alive, and they could not meet their needs on their own. The only logical solution was to try to appear to

<br>getting their needs met contradicts their childhood paradigms, Nice Guys are extremely uncomfortable 
<br>when they actually do get what they want. Though most Nice Guys have a difficult time grasping this 
<br>concept, they are terrified of getting what they really want and will go to extreme measures to make sure 
<br>they don&#x27;t. Nice Guys carry out this unconscious agenda by connecting with needy or unavailable 
<br>people, operating from an unspoken agenda, being unclear and indirect, pushing people away, and 
<br>sabotaging.

<br>Many of the Nice Guys I&#x27;ve worked with have expressed a heightened interest in sex, yet they frequently 
<br>feel frustrated in their attempts to get these needs met. This is usually because their actions pretty much 
<br>guarantee that they won&#x27;t get what they believe they want.

<br>negative experiences with sex, tend to have a difficult time being sexually expressive. When these 
<br>partners do make themselves available to be sexual, it is not uncommon for Nice Guys to do something 
<br>that further ensures that they don&#x27;t get their needs met. The Nice Guy may respond by taking control 
<br>rather than letting the sexual experience unfold. He may focus on his partner&#x27;s sexual needs before she 
<br>has a chance to pay attention to him. He might start a fight by making a comment about her weight or 
<br>her past unavailability. All of these strategies pretty much ensure that the Nice Guy won&#x27;t have to 
<br>experience the fear, shame, or anxiety that might get triggered if he actually allowed someone to focus 
<br>on his needs.

These 
<br>unconscious, unspoken agreements are the primary way that Nice Guys interact with the world around

<br>contract in which a person </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">gives to get</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Giving &quot;I love yous&quot; to get &quot;I love you toos&quot; in return is the 
<br>basic way Nice Guys go about trying to get all of their needs met. There is nothing wrong with asking 
<br>your partner to tell you she loves you, but telling her &quot;I love you&quot; first to get an &quot;I love you too&quot; in return 
<br>is indirect, unclear, and manipulative.

<br>caretaking. Nice Guys believe their caretaking is fundamentally loving and is one of the things that 
<br>makes them good people. In reality, caretaking has nothing to do with being loving or good. Caretaking 
<br>is an immature and indirect attempt to try to get one&#x27;s needs met.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">caretake in their intimate relationships. Reese, who is gay, lamented in one of his therapy sessions, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;Why can&#x27;t I find a partner who gives as much back to me as I give to him?&quot; He went on to describe how 
<br>all of his boyfriends seemed to be takers and that he always did all of the giving. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:49228px; width:571px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Within a period of a year, Reese entered into three intense relationships. Each began wonderfully and 
<br>seemed like the partnership he had been looking for. Each failed because of the same scenario: Reese 
<br>picked men who needed rescuing or fixing.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:49298px; width:586px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The first boyfriend lived in Canada and had recently gotten off drugs. He came to live with Reese but 
<br>never applied for a work visa and struggled to stay clean. Reese went out of his way to be supportive of 
<br>his boyfriend with the hope that he would find a job and stay off drugs. Finally, Reese sent him home to 
<br>get his life straightened out. Later, he found out from a mutual friend that the reason his boyfriend had 
<br>never applied for a work visa was because he was HIV positive, something he failed to tell Reese.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:49401px; width:586px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The next boyfriend was of a different race from Reese and had never come to grips with his 
<br>homosexuality. His parents and religion kept him in constant conflict. He was never able to commit to 
<br>the relationship. Nevertheless, Reese went out of his way to be supportive and giving, all with the hopes 
<br>that his boyfriend would eventually get things straightened out and become available to Reese.

He was living on base, some 40 miles from Reese&#x27;s apartment 
<br>and had no car. Reese had to take the initiative in getting together and would often shuttle his partner 
<br>around. Because Reese made more money, he always paid when they went out. Reese frequently bought 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:13px">his boyfriend gifts and loaned him money. When this boyfriend got transferred to a different state, Reese 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">quit his job, sold his car, and moved along with him, only to return in three months because his partner 
<br>started running around on him.

<br>boyfriends, he gave up his job and alienated most of his friends and family. Reese&#x27;s caretaking allowed

<br>to fix others. As is true for most Nice Guys, no matter how much he gave to others, Reese never felt like 
<br>he got as much back in return.

<br>encourage their partner to take a day off, buy a new outfit, go to the doctor, take a trip, quit a job, go

<br>consists of three predictable sequences:

<br>feels frustrated and resentful. Remember, the Nice Guy is the one keeping score and he isn&#x27;t totally 
<br>objective.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:50841px; width:578px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">3) When this frustration and resentment builds up long enough, it spills out in the form of rage attacks, 
<br>passive-aggressive behavior, pouting, tantrums, withdrawing, shaming, criticizing, blaming, even 
<br>physical abuse. Once the cycle has been completed, it usually just begins all over again.

<br>tantrum. Sometimes the victim puke will take a more passive-aggressive form in which the Nice Guy 
<br>will have an affair or act out in some hidden way. All the while the person doing the puking will feel 
<br>justified because of the many ways he has been victimized. These victim pukes are one of the primary 
<br>reasons Nice Guys aren&#x27;t always so nice.

<br>puking. Shane had Racquel on a pedestal and deep inside, he believed she could only love him if he was 
<br>&quot;good enough.&quot; In order to win her love he gave her gifts, sent her cards, left phone messages, bought 
<br>her clothes, planned special surprises, and helped with her home and children.

She felt like she could never repay 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Shane for everything he did for her. The truth was â she couldn&#x27;t. Shane was trying to buy her love â 
<br>only the contract wasn&#x27;t clear. In time, the only way she could cope with his pleasing and caretaking was 
<br>by pushing him away.

He couldn&#x27;t understand why if he had fulfilled his end of the 
<br>contract, Racquel wouldn&#x27;t keep hers. He didn&#x27;t think he was that hard to please. The more Shane gave to 
<br>Racquel, the more resentful he became. He would accuse her of not loving him. They would have 
<br>tremendous battles in which they would break up, calling each other all kinds of names. Afterwards 
<br>Shane would feel frightened and remorseful and pursue Racquel and try to fix things (all the while 
<br>resenting her for not pursuing him and trying to fix things). He would then start caretaking and pleasing 
<br>again to win her love. The cycle repeated itself over and over again.

<br>make getting their needs met a priority. Sometimes I have to repeat this truth many times in order for it 
<br>to sink in. For Nice Guys, having needs means being &quot;needy,&quot; and needy represents a one-way ticket to 
<br>abandonment.

I tried to plan some 
<br>time with my wife Elizabeth, but she seemed ambivalent and unwilling to make a commitment to what 
<br>she wanted to do. I felt frustrated and put my plans on hold. Finally, upon the urging of a friend, I 
<br>decided to try putting myself first over the weekend. I made plans and invited my wife to join me if she 
<br>felt inclined. I did several things I wanted, including spending some time with friends. As it turned out, 
<br>Elizabeth decided to join me on a number of occasions. On Monday, she shared with me that she had 
<br>thoroughly enjoyed the weekend and didn&#x27;t want it to end.

<br>members to experiment with putting themselves first for at least a week. Though the challenge created 
<br>tremendous anxiety for all of the men, each decided to accept it. The experiences of three of Lars, Reese, 
<br>and Shane are presented below.

<br>going to make his needs a priority for the following week. She was initially resistant to his proclamation 
<br>â which added to his anxiety. To boost his courage, Lars called a couple of men in the group. Their 
<br>encouragement gave him the support he needed to follow through with his commitment.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:53680px; width:591px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Lars decided to keep it simple. His plan for the week involved making time every day to go the gym and 
<br>work out. Before his children were born, Lars had been physically active. The demands of job, home and 
<br>children had put an end to that. Lars decided to alternate his workouts before and after work. When he 
<br>shared his plan with his wife, she applied a little guilt. &quot;That&#x27;s not fair that you get to work out and I 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:13px">don&#x27;t,&quot; she proclaimed. Lars was tempted to back down. He had an impulse to try to find a solution so 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">his wife could work out too. Instead, he reflected her concern and told her he was going to work out 
<br>anyway.

Nevertheless, 
<br>he persevered. After the third day, his wife actually asked him how his workout went. As the week

<br>enjoyed being around other people at the gym who were also taking good care of themselves. 
<br>Surprisingly, after his first week, his wife told him that he had inspired her to start taking better care of 
<br>herself. She told him that she was going to start dropping the kids off at the daycare center at the gym 
<br>and begin an aerobics class for herself.

<br>had begun to work on developing non-sexual relationships with men.

<br>Sunday nights. By Monday morning, he was exhausted. He would spend the rest of the week playing 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">catch up. Reese was afraid that if he didn&#x27;t go out whenever his boyfriend wanted, his boyfriend would

He told his 
<br>boyfriend in advance. Reese decided that he would go out just one night, not drink, and be in by 
<br>midnight. On Saturday, he made some plans to go to a movie with a couple of guys in the group. On 
<br>Sunday he stayed at home to relax and get caught up on some house cleaning and laundry. His goal was 
<br>to be in bed by 10:00 p.m. on Sunday evening.

Shane regularly gave 
<br>her gifts, planned surprises, and did whatever he could to help her out.

<br>something for his girlfriend. Whenever he felt this impulse, he would instead do something for himself. 
<br>When he thought about washing her car, he washed his own instead. When he felt the urge to buy her a 
<br>gift, he bought himself something instead. When he thought about calling her just to see if she was OK, 
<br>he called a group member instead. All of this created tremendous anxiety for Shane.

<br>actually looked forward to spending time with him. She even called late one evening after the kids were 
<br>in bed and invited him over to make love.

<br>They decided to continue the process. For a period of six months they agreed that Shane would not give 
<br>any gifts or plan any surprises for Racquel. During the following six months he refrained from giving 
<br>her birthday, Christmas, and Valentine&#x27;s cards or gifts. During this time he focused on taking better care 
<br>of himself and getting his needs met.

<br>giving to Shane. One year latter, they both reported that Shane could give a gift without using it as a way 
<br>to get approval or affirmation. During this time, Shane had also learned that making his needs a priority 
<br>made him less dependent, needy, and fearful. Both Shane and Racquel reported enjoying all the changes 
<br>they had experienced since Shane made the decision to start putting himself first.

<br>something I had done. Like many of our arguments, Elizabeth felt helpless to get me to see my denial. 
<br>At the same time, I felt unjustly persecuted. Finally, when the argument reached an emotional crescendo, 
<br>Elizabeth shouted in frustration,

This may not sound like a nice thing to say, but it&#x27;s true. Nice Guys tend to be 
<br>wimpy victims because their life paradigm and childhood survival mechanisms require them to sacrifice 
<br>their personal power.

<br>met in a timely, healthy fashion in childhood. These little boys were helpless to prevent people from 
<br>abandoning them, neglecting them, abusing them, using them, or smothering them. They </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">were</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> victims to 
<br>the people who failed to love them, pay attention to them, meet their needs, and protect them.

These 
<br>men tend to see others as causing the problems they are experiencing in life. As a consequence, they 
<br>often feel frustrated, helpless, resentful, and rageful. You can see it in their body language. You can hear 
<br>it in their voices.

<br>paradigm: &quot;If I am good, then I will be loved, get my needs met, and have a problem-free life.&quot; 
<br>Unfortunately, this paradigm not only produces the opposite of what is desired, it guarantees nothing but 
<br>feelings of perpetual powerlessness.

<br>prevent them from attaining this goal. The first is that they are attempting the impossible. Life is </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">not</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> 
<br>smooth. Human existence is by nature chaotic. Life is filled with experiences that are unpredictable and 
<br>beyond anyone&#x27;s control. Therefore, trying to create a predictable life in which everything always goes 
<br>as planned is an exercise in futility.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:58482px; width:583px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In spite of the fact that we live in a chaotic, unpredictable world, Nice Guys are not only convinced that 
<br>life can be smooth, they believe it </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">should</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> be. This belief is the direct result of their childhood 
<br>abandonment experiences. The unpredictability of not having their needs met in a timely, judicious 
<br>fashion was not only frightening, it was potentially life-threatening.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:58568px; width:590px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">In attempt to cope with the uncertainty of their chaotic childhood, Nice Guys developed a belief 
<br>system that if they could just do everything right, then everything would go right in their lives.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> 
<br>Sometimes these men also developed belief systems that their childhood was ideal and problem-free (the 
<br>opposite of reality) in order to cope with their abandonment experiences. These were all distorted 
<br>beliefs, but these illusions helped these helpless little boys deal with the turmoil that was out of their 
<br>control.

<br>opposite of what works. By approaching adult situations with survival mechanisms that were formed 
<br>when they were naive and powerless, they are insured of having very little success in creating anything 
<br>that resembles stability in their lives.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:58774px; width:579px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The dependence on these ineffective survival mechanisms keeps Nice Guys trapped in the memory of 
<br>their fearful childhood experiences and perpetuates a vicious cycle. The more frightened they are, the 
<br>more they use their childhood survival mechanisms. The more they use these ineffective mechanisms, 
<br>the less successful they are at negotiating the complexities, challenges and ambiguities of life. The less 
<br>successful they are, the more fearful they become . . . you get the picture.

Gil had reached a crisis point in his relationship with his 
<br>girlfriend Barb. Gil had originally begun couples counseling with Barb to &quot;fix&quot; her problem. He claimed 
<br>that she was depressed, angry all the time, and had no interest in sex. He reported that he constantly 
<br>walked on eggshells, trying to make sure he never did anything to upset her.

They had 
<br>discussed marriage, but both felt apprehension due to the unsettled nature of their relationship. After a 
<br>couple months of couples counseling, Gil began to entertain the idea that all the problems in the 
<br>relationship might not be about Barb. He began looking at his own caretaking and controlling behavior. 
<br>He also became aware that he had few outside interests and no male friends. After a couple more 
<br>months, he joined a No More Mr. Nice Guy! men&#x27;s group.

<br>making Barb better. It was a slow process, but Gil began to see that he could not do anything to change 
<br>Barb and that he was going to have to focus on himself. As he began to let go and detach from Barb he 
<br>felt tremendous anxiety. He had a deep fear that he was going to &quot;get in trouble.&quot; He also believed that 
<br>Barb couldn&#x27;t handle her problems without his help.

<br>seemed to be when he made the decision that he didn&#x27;t care whether they made it together or not. That

<br>wife, Les revealed how Sarah had gained 60 pounds since they married, refused to cook, was depressed, 
<br>no longer wanted to have sex with him, treated him with contempt, and would rage at him without 
<br>provocation. In spite of all these things, Les maintained that his wife was the woman of his dreams and 
<br>that he loved her dearly.

<br>his wife and his relationship with her. This was a slow and difficult process. Les needed to see Sarah in a 
<br>certain way because of his fear of being alone. To dwell in reality might mean he would have to do 
<br>something frightening or difficult.

<br>change allowed him to start asking for what he wanted, set boundaries, and express his feelings of 
<br>resentment and anger. It soon became apparent that Sarah had no desire to look at her role in the 
<br>relationship or make any kind of changes. Though it was painful and frightening, accepting things as 
<br>they really were allowed Les to make the decision to move out and file for divorce.

<br>share what I was feeling. Like most Nice Guys, I had come to see feelings as a dangerous thing. After 30 
<br>plus years of conditioning, I had no clue what Elizabeth wanted from me.

It is almost comical how 
<br>infrequently it crosses a Nice Guy&#x27;s mind to tell his partner what he is feeling. On one occasion 
<br>Elizabeth confronted me when I shared a feeling with her that I had been harboring for some time. &quot;Why 
<br>didn&#x27;t you tell me about that when you first felt it?&quot; she questioned.

<br>telling you.&quot;

<br>hurt anyone. The truth is they are covering their own butts. What they are really saying is that they don&#x27;t 
<br>want to do anything that might recreate their childhood experiences. They&#x27;re really not trying to protect 
<br>anyone from harm, they&#x27;re just trying to keep their world smooth and under control.

<br>a Nice Guy is feeling anxious, helpless, shameful, lonely, rageful, or sad, his feelings aren&#x27;t life-
<br>threatening.

<br>Men who are in touch with their feelings are powerful, assertive, and energized. Contrary to what many 
<br>Nice Guys believe, they don&#x27;t have to become more like women in order to have their feelings. This is 
<br>why I support men in learning about their feelings from other men.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:62835px; width:591px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">While there is no formula, or &quot;right&quot; way to get reconnected with repressed feelings, support groups can 
<br>teach, model, and support this slow, but important process. In a sense, a therapy group can become like a 
<br>family. In this environment, recovering Nice Guys can ask for the kind of help in dealing with feelings 
<br>that was never available to them as children. Since feelings are often messy, a group environment can 
<br>represent a supportive place to momentarily feel out of control. Here, recovering Nice Guys find out

Elizabeth came to me one day 
<br>and revealed that she had backed into a parked car. She felt like a bad little child and waited for me to 
<br>scold her. Even before I had a chance to respond, she began to put up a wall and withdraw as a way of 
<br>protecting herself.

<br>my feelings clearly and directly. Without shaming or attacking I said &quot;Stop.&quot; With an intensity of 
<br>emotion that surprised both of us, I let her know that I wasn&#x27;t pushing her away and I wasn&#x27;t going to 
<br>accept her pushing me away. I told her that I did have feelings about the car, but I had even stronger 
<br>feelings about how she was acting. I said, &quot;Just let me have my feelings about the car, and then we&#x27;ll 
<br>work it out.&quot;

<br>feelings. She was able to hear that I was upset about the car but that I didn&#x27;t think she was bad and I 
<br>wasn&#x27;t going to abandon her. The fact that I had such intensity about not letting her push me away 
<br>actually made her feel secure and loved. As a result, she felt safe to stay connected to me and hear my 
<br>feelings about the car. The whole incident brought us closer and has since provided a reference point for 
<br>the healing power of expressing emotions in powerful and direct ways.

<br>not having their needs met in a timely, judicious manner. It was fostered by fearful systems that

<br>recommendation of a friend. He had been separated from his wife for a year but was having a difficult 
<br>time making a final decision about getting divorced.

<br>Nolan constantly weighed all the issues. What if he left his wife and later realized that it was a mistake? 
<br>What if he messed up his kids&#x27; lives? What if his children never wanted to talk to him again? What if his 
<br>friends thought he was bad? What if God sent him to hell? As long as Nolan stayed &quot;confused&quot; about 
<br>what he should do, he remained paralyzed.

<br>He didn&#x27;t like seeing himself as being fearful. As we explored the memory fear from his childhood, he 
<br>came to realize that any mistakes he made as a child seemed to have everlasting consequences. He 
<br>believed the same would be true in his present situation.

Every time the Nice Guy confronts a 
<br>fear, he unconsciously creates a belief that he can handle whatever it is he is afraid of. This challenges 
<br>his memory fear. Challenging this memory fear makes the things outside of him seem less threatening. 
<br>As these things seem less frightening, he feels more confident in confronting them. The more this

<br>fundamentally dishonest. They have the ability to tell a lie or withhold the truth and still believe the 
<br>illusion that they are basically honest people. Since dishonesty is a fear-based behavior, telling lies and 
<br>withholding the truth robs Nice Guys of their personal power.

This may seem evident to most people, but it is important 
<br>to define &quot;lying,&quot; and &quot;telling the truth,&quot; because Nice Guys are adept at creating definitions that justify 
<br>their behavior. It is not unusual to hear them make statements like &quot;I&#x27;m pretty honest&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m honest 
<br>most of the time&quot; without the slightest awareness of their contradiction of terms. In almost a childlike 
<br>manner, Nice Guys will often offer the following defense: &quot;I didn&#x27;t lie, I just didn&#x27;t tell everything.&quot;

<br>his whereabouts, it never crossed his mind that he was lying to himself and to his wife. The bottom line

<br>want others to know, what they least want to reveal. These are the things they are most likely to hold 
<br>back â and the things they most need to tell. Sometimes they have to practice telling a certain truth

<br>is actually easier than living one built around deceit and distortion.

<br>on trying to guess what everyone else would think is right. Following this committee approach is the 
<br>quickest path to confusion, fear, powerlessness, and dishonesty.

<br>feel uncomfortable. It is not unusual for a Nice Guy to stand well back from the line, allowing me to 
<br>violate his space several steps before he even begins to respond. Once I start pushing, it&#x27;s not uncommon 
<br>for a Nice Guy to let me push him back several steps before he does anything to stop me. Sometimes a 
<br>Nice Guy will let me push him all the way to the wall.

Nice Guys 
<br>are usually more comfortable back-pedaling, giving in, and keeping the peace. They believe if they take 
<br>one more step backward, the other person will quit pushing, and then everything will be smooth.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:66889px; width:590px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">It is not unusual for recovering Nice Guys to go a little overboard when they first learn about boundary 
<br>setting. They have a tendency to swing from one extreme to another. They become Kamikaze boundary 
<br>setters. They try to set boundaries with a sledge hammer or machete. They usually learn in time that they 
<br>only have to use as much resistance as necessary to get the job done.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:66975px; width:572px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In time, they also learn that boundary setting isn&#x27;t about getting other people to be different, but about 
<br>getting themselves to be different. If someone is crossing their boundary, it isn&#x27;t the other person&#x27;s 
<br>problem, it is theirs.

<br>intolerable. </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Due to their childhood conditioning, they teach the people around them that they will 
<br>accept having their boundaries violated.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> As recovering Nice Guys begin to take responsibility for how 
<br>they let people treat them, their own behavior begins to change. As they stop reinforcing things they 
<br>aren&#x27;t willing to tolerate, the people around them are given the opportunity to behave differently. This 
<br>gives relationships a chance to survive and grow.

<br>kill a relationship, and how setting boundaries can give a relationship a chance to survive.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:67217px; width:589px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Just prior to his marriage to his wife Kisha, Kisha had an affair with an old boyfriend. Because Jake 
<br>didn&#x27;t want to lose her, he forgave her and promised to never bring up her infidelity. This established a 
<br>pattern of Kisha pretty much doing whatever she wanted while Jake withheld his feelings and walked on 
<br>eggshells. He would always measure his words in order to avoid saying anything &quot;wrong&quot; that might 
<br>upset her.

<br>too much to drink she would become belligerent and promiscuous. On this occasion she made several 
<br>demeaning remarks to Jake and spent most of the evening slow dancing with other men in the bar.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:67506px; width:584px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">After holding his tongue as long as he could, Jake finally told Kisha that she was drunk and that it was 
<br>time to go home. She swore at him and kept on doing what she was doing. Jake retaliated by calling her 
<br>a &quot;bitch&quot; and drove home. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:67575px; width:587px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">One of her friends brought Kisha home the next morning. For the rest of the day she gave Jake the silent 
<br>treatment. He tried to hold out, but after a few hours of misery, he apologized for calling her a bitch.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:67628px; width:589px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Later that week, he somewhat reluctantly talked about the episode in his No More Mr. Nice Guy! group. 
<br>The group members lovingly confronted him. They pointed out how his willingness to tolerate his wife&#x27;s 
<br>intolerable behavior gave her a license to act in any way she pleased. They told Jake that the problem 
<br>was not Kisha, it was him. Until Jake changed, his wife would have no incentive to change. By not 
<br>setting boundaries he was robbing his marriage of the opportunity to become what it could be.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:67731px; width:580px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The next day, Jake confronted his wife. He acknowledged his role in their situation. He told her that he 
<br>was no longer going to tolerate intolerable behavior. He told her his boundaries. He would no longer 
<br>tolerate Kisha dancing or flirting with other men. He would not tolerate her demeaning him in front of 
<br>their friends. He told her that if she wanted to stay married to him, she had to go to treatment for her 
<br>drinking problem.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:67834px; width:583px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Kisha responded by telling Jake that no one was going to tell her what to do. She packed a bag and 
<br>moved out that night to a friend&#x27;s house. Even though Jake was miserable the next few days, he resisted 
<br>the temptation to call her and beg her to come back. Instead, he called some guys in the group.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:67903px; width:589px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Three nights later, Kisha called and said she wanted to talk. She came over and told Jake that even 
<br>though she initially wanted to tell him to go to hell, she knew he was right. For the first time in their 
<br>marriage, she said she felt respect for him. She said she wanted to save their marriage and was willing to 
<br>do whatever it took to make it work. The following week Kisha entered treatment.

<br>history in which it was not always a good thing to be male. This was primarily the result of two 
<br>significant family and social changes in the post war era: 1) boys were disconnected from their fathers 
<br>and other healthy male role models, and 2) boys were forced to seek approval from women and accept a 
<br>female definition of what it meant to be male.

<br>any negative male traits (like those of their fathers or other &quot;bad&quot; men) and become what they believed 
<br>women wanted them to be. For many men, this life strategy seemed essential if they wanted to be loved, 
<br>get their needs met, and have a smooth life.

<br>limited to just men of the baby boom generation. I frequently observe men in their thirties, twenties, and

<br>and more passive.

<br>approval of women. This seems logical considering the anti-male climate that has permeated our culture 
<br>since the 1960s. Ironically, these same men frequently complain that women seemed to be attracted to 
<br>&quot;jerks&quot; rather than Nice Guys like them. Many women have shared with me that due to the absence of 
<br>any discernible life energy in Nice Guys, there is little to be attracted to. They also reveal that their 
<br>tendency to be attracted to &quot;jerks&quot; is because these men have more of a masculine edge to them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:71803px; width:588px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As Nice Guys try to avoid the dark side of their masculinity, they also repress many other aspects of this 
<br>male energy force. As a result, they often lose their sexual assertiveness, competitiveness, creativity, 
<br>ego, thirst for experience, boisterousness, exhibitionism, and power. Go watch little boys on the 
<br>playground and you will see these qualities. I am convinced that these are good things worth keeping.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:71889px; width:591px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">One of the most visible consequences of the repression of masculine energy in Nice Guys is their lack of 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">leadership in their families. Out of fear of upsetting their partner or appearing too much like their 
<br>controlling, authoritarian, or abusive fathers, Nice Guys frequently fail to be the leader their family 
<br>needs. Consequently, the job of leading the family often falls on their wives. Most of the women I talk to 
<br>don&#x27;t want this job, but end up taking it by default.

<br>unconscious bond is the result of a normal childhood developmental phenomenon gone amuck. Let me 
<br>explain.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:72108px; width:587px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">All little boys naturally fall in love with their mother and desire to have her all to themselves. Healthy 
<br>mothers and fathers help their sons successfully move through this normal developmental stage. As they 
<br>do, the young boy individuates from his mother, bonds with men, and becomes available for an intimate 
<br>relationship with another woman in adulthood.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:72194px; width:581px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Each parent plays a significant role in facilitating this healthy transition. First, the mother must know 
<br>how to give enough to meet the child&#x27;s needs without creating dependency. She must also know how to 
<br>get her own needs met so she is not tempted to use her son to fill the void. Second, the father must be 
<br>present and have a healthy bond with his son. This connection helps the little boy move from the cozy 
<br>lap of his mother to the challenging world of men.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:72297px; width:579px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As stated above, most Nice Guys do not report having had close a relationship with their father in 
<br>childhood. As a result, many Nice Guys were forced into an unhealthy bond with their mother. This 
<br>bond might have formed if they had to please an angry, critical, or controlling mother. More often than 
<br>not, the bond was the result of being forced to take care of a needy, dependent, or smothering mother.

<br>from men and what he could do to start changing the pattern.

Even then, it took more than a year 
<br>before he began doing things with the men outside of the group. As he did, these men were able to give 
<br>him feedback about his defense mechanisms that kept him isolated. These men also supported him in 
<br>changing the ways he related to his wife.

<br>marriage. Alan had made his wife his emotional center. His life revolved around trying to please her and 
<br>make her happy. Due to his ineffective covert contracts, Alan never believed Marie gave as much to him 
<br>as he gave to her. As a result, he was often resentful and passive-aggressive. When Alan began to get his 
<br>emotional and social needs met with men, it took a lot of pressure off his wife.

Perhaps one of the 
<br>most significant benefits for Nice Guys is that it improves their relationships with women. I consistently 
<br>tell Nice Guys, &quot;The best thing you can do for your relationship with your girlfriend or wife is to have 
<br>male friends.&quot; As they get many of their emotional needs met with men, recovering Nice Guys become 
<br>less dependent, needy, manipulative and resentful in their relationships with women.

<br>approval or allowing themselves to be defined by the opposite sex. If the Nice Guy&#x27;s girlfriend or wife is 
<br>angry at him or thinks he is a jerk, he can take comfort in knowing his buddies think he is OK. He is 
<br>therefore less likely to resort to peacekeeping or fixing to try and keep his partner happy.

<br>agenda. A Nice Guy will frequently avoid doing anything that might upset his partner and cause her to 
<br>not want to have sex with him. With men, recovering Nice Guys don&#x27;t feel like they have to please, 
<br>placate, lie, caretake or sacrifice like they believe they have to with women. Not having a sexual agenda 
<br>removes the fear and dysfunctional dances so common for Nice Guys in their relationships with the 
<br>opposite sex.

<br>her hook an emotional hose up to him. Jamie could tell that this was primarily the result of her boyfriend 
<br>having bonded with several guys in boot camp and from embracing his own masculinity.

Because of their conditioning, Nice Guys tend to fear these 
<br>traits. As a result, they often become emotionally and physically soft. Some even take pride in this 
<br>softness. I&#x27;ve met many Nice Guys who work out or practice martial arts, but who are still afraid of their 
<br>strength.

In order to do this, 
<br>recovering Nice Guys have to stop putting junk into their bodies and train them to respond to the 
<br>physical demands of being male. This involves eating healthy foods, eliminating drugs and alcohol, 
<br>working out, drinking lots of water, playing, relaxing, and getting enough rest. Whether the Nice Guy 
<br>stays fit by running, swimming, weight training, martial arts, playing basketball, volleyball, or tennis, 
<br>this physical strength translates into self-confidence and power in every other aspect of his life.

Travis came to see me to deal with his marital 
<br>difficulties. During the first session of counseling, two things became immediately evident: First, Travis 
<br>was a Nice Guy, and second, he had a drug and alcohol problem. I told him I would work with him only 
<br>if he got a drug and alcohol assessment, quit drinking, and started attending Alcoholics Anonymous. 
<br>Travis complied with all my boundaries and asked if he could join one of the No More Mr. Nice Guy!

In 
<br>addition to marital problems, it also became apparent that Travis had a number of other lifestyle 
<br>problems. His diet consisted primarily of fast food. He was a chain smoker and he drank several cups of 
<br>coffee a day. He worked long hours and got absolutely no exercise.

He started taking time 
<br>away from work to attend AA meetings and spend time with other recovering men. He decided to have a 
<br>surgery he had been putting off for years. Since he wouldn&#x27;t be able to smoke for a few days, he decided 
<br>it was a good time to quit for good. After his surgery, he began going for walks during his lunch hour. 
<br>He started drinking more water and cut back on his coffee and soft drink consumption. He even took a 
<br>week off from work and went fishing with some friends in Alaska.

With his 
<br>lifestyle changes and the support of the group he had come to realize that his combative relationship 
<br>with his wife was his last bad habit that needed to go. While relaying his decision to the group, he 
<br>revealed that his wife blamed the group for killing their marriage. Travis smiled and then wiped a tear 
<br>from the corner of his eye. &quot;Thanks to this group, I feel strong. I never could have made these changes 
<br>without your help. This group didn&#x27;t kill my marriage, it saved my life.&quot;

On one occasion 
<br>in a No More Mr. Nice Guy! group, Matthew stated that he had no intention of attending his father&#x27;s 
<br>funeral if he should die. Months later, after exploring his relationship with his father in group, he 
<br>decided to call and confront his dad when he didn&#x27;t get invited to a family function.

While

<br>had created a similar scenario with his wife in which he identified her as the villain and himself as the

<br>with his wife.

<br>that Nice Guys hold them accountable by expressing their feelings to them â including rage and anger. 
<br>This is essential, even if these men are dead. Sometimes this takes place in their fathers&#x27; presence, 
<br>sometimes not. It&#x27;s not so important that the father is available to do this work. What is essential is that

<br>&quot;How did I do? Was I believable?&quot; In these cultures, the men and women work together to facilitate this 
<br>process of transition and initiation.

<br>own. I have a theory that the phase that adolescent boys pass through where they dress sloppily, look 
<br>scraggly, act aggressively, hole up in their room, slouch, play loud music, swear, and spit a lot, are all 
<br>unconsciously aimed at making themselves so repulsive that even their mothers can&#x27;t stand them. This 
<br>helps them break the symbiotic bonds with their moms. Nevertheless, these young men still need help 
<br>from adult males in pulling away from their mothers without feeling guilt and shame and without overly 
<br>self-destructive behaviors.

<br>culture. This is because there are certain things that boys can only learn from men. As Nice Guys 
<br>embrace their masculinity, they can teach their sons what it means to be male. This includes how to 
<br>handle their aggression, how to handle their libido, how to relate to women, how to bond with a man, 
<br>and perhaps most importantly, how to embrace their own masculinity. Men teach these lessons both by 
<br>example and by interaction with young boys.

<br>I&#x27;m around my boys, I get to see unbridled maleness in action. Not only do I get to teach my sons how to 
<br>handle their testosterone-related behaviors such as aggression and sexuality, they also show me how to 
<br>embrace mine.

Fathers need to take their sons hunting and fishing, 
<br>work on cars with them, take them to work, coach their teams, take them to ball games, work out with 
<br>them, take them on business trips, and let them tag along with them when they go out with the guys. All 
<br>of these activities help boys move successfully into the male world.

Nice Guys can get involved with young 
<br>relatives, scouts, sports teams, school activities, or big brothers.

One night in his men&#x27;s 
<br>group, Trey talked about his nephew who was being raised by Trey&#x27;s sister, a single mother. Trey had 
<br>strong feelings about what was happening to his nephew because the boy was going through some of the 
<br>same rebellion and acting out with alcohol that Trey had experienced at the same age. The group 
<br>encouraged Trey to reach out to his nephew and be a positive male influence.

Sometimes some hidden behavior â

<br>a crisis with their wife or girlfriend. More often, their call to a therapist is motivated by some problem or 
<br>dissatisfaction in their most intimate relationship; their partner doesn&#x27;t want to have sex as often as they 
<br>do, she is depressed, angry, unavailable, or unfaithful (or all of the above).

<br>allow others to peer into these same places. It would require the Nice Guy to let someone get close 
<br>enough to see into all the nooks and crannies of his soul. This terrifies Nice Guys, because being known 
<br>means being found out. All Nice Guys have worked their entire lives to become what they believe others

<br>everything Nice Guys fear most.

<br>Nice Guys enter a relationship they begin a balancing act. In relationships, a life-and-death struggle is 
<br>played out to balance their fear of vulnerability with their fear of isolation. Vulnerability means someone 
<br>may get too close to them and see how bad they are. Nice Guys are convinced that when others make 
<br>this discovery, these people will hurt them, shame them, or leave them.

He finds it

<br>found out.

<br>some pretty messed up people. The fact that these partners may have challenges â they are single 
<br>moms, they have financial problems, they are angry, addictive, depressed, overweight, non-sexual, or 
<br>unable to be faithful â is precisely the reason Nice Guys invite these people into their lives. As long as 
<br>attention is focused on the flaws of the partner, it is diverted away from the internalized toxic shame of 
<br>the Nice Guy. This balancing act ensures that the Nice Guy&#x27;s closest relationship will most likely be his 
<br>least intimate.

<br>They Want
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:84788px; width:578px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">This intimacy balancing act gets played out in two distinct ways for Nice Guys. The first is through 
<br>becoming overly involved in an intimate relationship at the expense of one&#x27;s self and other outside 
<br>interests. The second is through being emotionally unavailable to a primary partner while playing the 
<br>Nice Guy role outside of the relationship. I call the first type of Nice Guy an </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">enmesher</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> and the second 
<br>type an </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">avoider</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:84891px; width:585px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The enmeshing Nice Guy makes his partner his emotional center. His world revolves around her. She is 
<br>more important than his work, his buddies, his hobbies. He will do whatever it takes to make her happy. 
<br>He will give her gifts, try to fix her problems, and arrange his schedule to be with her. He will gladly 
<br>sacrifice his wants and needs to win her love. He will even tolerate her bad moods, rage attacks, 
<br>addictions, and emotional or sexual unavailability â all because he &quot;loves her so much.&quot;

They are like little dogs who hover beneath 
<br>the table just in case a scrap happens to fall their way. Enmeshing Nice Guys do this same hovering 
<br>routine around their partner just in case she happens to drop him a scrap of sexual interest, a scrap of her 
<br>time, a scrap of a good mood, or a scrap of her attention. Even though they are settling for the leftovers 
<br>that fall from the table, enmeshing Nice Guys think they are getting something really good.

<br>relationship, but this is an illusion. The Nice Guy&#x27;s pursuing and enmeshing behavior is an attempt to 
<br>hook up an emotional hose to his partner. This hose is used to suck the life out of her and fill an empty 
<br>place inside of him. The Nice Guy&#x27;s partner unconsciously picks up on this agenda and works like hell to 
<br>make sure the Nice Guy can&#x27;t get close enough to hook up the hose. Consequently, the Nice Guy&#x27;s 
<br>partner is often seen as the one preventing the closeness the Nice Guy desires.

<br>hobby, parents, and everything else before his primary relationship.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> He may not seem like a Nice 
<br>Guy to his partner at all because he is often nice to everyone else but her. He may volunteer to work on 
<br>other people&#x27;s cars. He may spend weekends fixing his mother&#x27;s roof. He may work two or three jobs. 
<br>He may coach his children&#x27;s sports teams. Even though he may not follow his partner around and cater to 
<br>her every whim, he still operates from a covert contract that since he is a Nice Guy, his partner should be 
<br>available to him, even if he isn&#x27;t available to her.

They may help 
<br>the Nice Guy feel safe, but they won&#x27;t help him feel loved.

<br>often help her become what he needs. He may project upon her one or more traits of his parents. He may 
<br>act as if she is a certain way, even when she isn&#x27;t. His unconscious dysfunctional needs may literally 
<br>force his partner to respond in an equally dysfunctional way.

As a child, I never knew what kind of mood my father would be in when I came into the 
<br>house. More often than not, it wasn&#x27;t good. I learned to come home prepared for the worst. I later 
<br>recreated the same pattern in my marriage. I projected my father&#x27;s unpredictable moods onto my wife 
<br>and would frequently arrive home prepared for her to be angry. Even if she was in a good mood, my 
<br>defensiveness often triggered some kind of confrontation between us. Thus Elizabeth came to look like 
<br>my angry father and I perpetuated a familiar, though dysfunctional relationship dynamic.

<br>one desires. I frequently encourage recovering Nice Guys to be </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">just who they are, without reservation</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. I 
<br>support them in deciding what is right for them and being that with all of their energy for the whole 
<br>world to see. The people who like them just as they are will hang around. The people who don&#x27;t, won&#x27;t. 
<br>This is the only way to have a healthy relationship. No one really wants to believe that they have to be 
<br>false or hide who they really are to get someone to love them or stay with them. Yet, this is a common 
<br>dynamic in the intimate relationships Nice Guys create. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:88659px; width:589px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">George is a good example of what can happen when a recovering Nice Guy decides to start pleasing 
<br>himself and stop pleasing his partner. Throughout his relationship with his wife Susan, George&#x27;s primary 
<br>goal was to make her happy. Over a period of five years George gave up hunting and fishing (two of his 
<br>passions), quit hanging out with his friends, turned the control of his finances over to Susan, and 
<br>supported her in quitting her job because she was unhappy at work. These changes occurred gradually. 
<br>All were an attempt on George&#x27;s part to please Susan. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:88779px; width:577px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Nevertheless, Susan was rarely happy. By the time George joined a No More Mr. Nice Guy! group, he 
<br>felt helpless and resentful and was ready to leave his wife. George saw Susan as the cause of the 
<br>frustration he was feeling. George spent the first few weeks in our group complaining about his wife. 
<br>Eventually, the group members began to confront George on his victim role and challenged him to do 
<br>something different instead of blaming Susan.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:88882px; width:584px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">It took a few more months, but George began to change. The most significant change was a conscious 
<br>decision to quit trying to make Susan happy. He realized that his attempts to please her weren&#x27;t working 
<br>and were causing him to feel resentful.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:88951px; width:583px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">George began by setting aside one weekend a month to go hunting or fishing. When Susan tried several 
<br>different methods to manipulate him or guilt him out of his decision, he held fast. Next, instead of 
<br>handing his paycheck over to Susan to control, he began giving himself an allowance to spend how he 
<br>wanted. This too drew resistance from his wife. Perhaps the most frightening step was when George set 
<br>up a budget and told Susan that if she wanted more control over the income, she would have to go back 
<br>to working full time.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:89071px; width:575px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Ironically, two things began to happen. George felt less like a victim and actually started having more 
<br>positive feelings toward Susan. Second, Susan began taking charge of her own life and became less 
<br>dependent on George. After about a year in group, George shared how much more content he was and 
<br>how much his marriage had improved. He gave credit to the group members who supported him in 
<br>finding the courage to start pleasing himself and stop trying to make Susan happy.

Nowhere is the issue of boundary setting more 
<br>important for Nice Guys than in their most intimate relationships. By setting healthy boundaries with 
<br>their partners, Nice Guys create situations in which both they and their partner can feel safe to be 
<br>vulnerable and experience true intimacy. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:89594px; width:589px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I show Nice Guys, often with their partners watching, how to step up to their line and set boundaries. On 
<br>more than one occasion, I have had the partner of a Nice Guy applaud during the demonstration. The 
<br>Nice Guy will turn, slack-jawed, and say, &quot;You mean you want me to stand up to you, dear?&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:89663px; width:532px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;Of course I do,&quot; she will respond, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be married to someone I can walk all over.&quot;

She doesn&#x27;t feel safe knowing she can push you 
<br>around. She wants to know that you will stand up to her. That is how she will feel secure in the 
<br>relationship. But, here&#x27;s the catch. She has to test to see if she can trust you. The first time you set a 
<br>boundary with her she may react intensely. She will push against it. She will tell you that you are wrong 
<br>for setting that boundary. She will do her best to find out if your boundary is for real.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:89802px; width:589px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">When a recovering Nice Guy sets boundaries with his partner, it makes her feel secure. In general, when 
<br>women feel secure, they feel loved. She will also come to know that if her partner will stand up to her, 
<br>he is also likely to stand up for her. Setting boundaries also creates respect. When a Nice Guy fails to set 
<br>boundaries it communicates to his partner that he doesn&#x27;t really honor himself, so why should she?
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:89888px; width:579px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">To help Nice Guys decide if they need to set a boundary with a particular behavior, I have them apply 
<br>the </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Second Date Rule.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Using the second date rule, Nice Guys ask themselves, &quot;If this behavior had 
<br>occurred on the second date, would there have been a third?&quot; This question helps them see if they have 
<br>been putting up with something that they shouldn&#x27;t.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:89975px; width:587px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">When trying to decide how to deal with a behavior they have deemed unacceptable, I encourage Nice 
<br>Guys to apply the </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Healthy Male Rule.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Following this rule of thumb, they simply ask themselves, &quot;How 
<br>would a healthy male handle this situation?&quot; For some reason, just asking this question connects them 
<br>with their intuitive wisdom and helps them access the power they need to respond appropriately.

<br>him, get close, have feelings, be sexual, and so on. He can let these things happen because he is 
<br>confident that at any point, if he begins to feel uncomfortable, he can say &quot;stop,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; or &quot;slow down,&quot; 
<br>or can remove himself. He can do whatever he needs to do to take care of himself.

When Nice Guys enter a relationship, they frequently 
<br>choose partners who look more dysfunctional than they do. This creates a dangerous illusion that one of 
<br>them is sicker than the other. This is a distortion, because healthy people are not attracted to unhealthy 
<br>people â and vice versa. I frequently tell couples that if you have one obviously wounded person in a 
<br>relationship, you always have two. No exception.

<br>broken one while I was designated the healthy one. These scripts worked well for both of us until she 
<br>started going to counseling. One day, she came home from a therapy session and announced that she had 
<br>discovered that I was just as messed up as she was. Because I couldn&#x27;t entertain the idea that I was 
<br>&quot;messed up,&quot; I responded, &quot;No, you are really finding out that you are just as healthy as I am.&quot;

<br>roles. Unfortunately, it also prevented any kind of real intimacy until Elizabeth began to challenge the 
<br>status quo. I&#x27;ve listened to countless Nice Guys who have formed relationships like the one Elizabeth 
<br>and I initially created. These men have the belief that they are victims to their &quot;sick&quot; partner&#x27;s 
<br>dysfunction. This illusion keeps everyone involved stuck in repetitive, ineffective patterns.

<br>partner to get in touch with their childhood experiences of abandonment, neglect, abuse, and smothering. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">They can use this information to better understand why they have created the kind of relationship system 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">they have. This process enables them to make changes that allow them to get what they want in their 
<br>intimate relationships.

<br>him to address childhood issues that prevent him from having a truly intimate relationship.

<br>critical mother. Karl never knew when his mom might get angry, criticize, or shame him. In adulthood, 
<br>Karl co-created a similar dynamic with Danita. When she got angry, Karl would use all of his childhood 
<br>survival mechanisms, like avoidance and withdrawal, to try to cope. Karl would accuse Danita of &quot;being 
<br>angry all the time&quot; and would walk on eggshells to avoid upsetting her. Karl would tell himself, &quot;I don&#x27;t 
<br>deserve this.&quot; He would then retreat and create escape scenarios in his head.

<br>help him clean out his old issues around his fear of angry and critical people. As Karl made this shift

<br>standing up to Danita rather than avoiding and withdrawing. As he came to see Danita&#x27;s anger as a result 
<br>of her own childhood wounding, Danita began to look less and less angry to him. As his view of his wife 
<br>began to shift, Karl began to feel more loving toward Danita and their relationship began to show 
<br>marked improvement.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:92287px; width:590px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">A couple of years ago we bought a Weimaraner puppy. We decided that if we were going to have a big 
<br>dog in the house, we should take him to obedience school. One of the first lessons we learned was that 
<br>we were the ones who needed obedience training. Most dogs that behave badly, we found out, have been 
<br>conditioned to do so by ignorant or inconsistent owners.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:92373px; width:570px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In many ways, humans aren&#x27;t much different from pets. People often behave the way they have been 
<br>trained to behave. For example, if a person gives his dog a treat when he pisses on the carpet, the dog 
<br>will keep pissing on the carpet. The same is true for humans. If the Nice Guy reinforces his partner&#x27;s 
<br>undesirable behaviors, she will keep behaving in undesirable ways.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:92459px; width:591px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Here is the irony for Nice Guys: Nice Guys like the idea of a smooth and problem-free relationship. 
<br>Typically, if their partner is unhappy, depressed, angry, or having a problem, they will jump right in and 
<br>try and fix it or make it better. They believe that by doing so, they will make the problem go away and 
<br>everything will quickly get back to normal. Unfortunately, this is like giving a dog a treat for pissing on 
<br>the carpet. Every time a Nice Guy responds to or pays attention to a behavior he would like to eliminate, 
<br>he is actually reinforcing that very behavior. This reinforcement increases the likelihood that that 
<br>behavior will occur again. For example, Joe&#x27;s wife frequently came home from work in a silent rage over

<br>attempt to relieve his anxiety, he would ask his wife what was wrong. After a little coaxing, she would 
<br>spend the next couple of hours venting to Joe about how mistreated she was at work. Joe would listen 
<br>and offer helpful suggestions, hoping that by doing so, she would get over her mood.

Every 
<br>time he asked his wife what was wrong, listened for hours, and offered advice, he was actually 
<br>reinforcing a behavior pattern he found undesirable.

<br>paying attention to it.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> The same is true in relationships.

He was oblivious to the fact that he 
<br>was responsible for perpetuating a behavior he found undesirable. When the men in his No More Mr. 
<br>Nice Guy! group pointed this fact out to him, he decided to try something different.

He ate dinner in 
<br>silence and then went out to the garage. Even though he felt intense anxiety, he resisted his impulses to 
<br>try to &quot;fix&quot; his wife. As he lay awake in bed that night, the deafening silence kept him awake for hours. 
<br>The next morning, the silence continued. Joe was afraid this behavior might go on forever. In an attempt 
<br>to relieve his anxiety, he tried making a little small talk. His wife responded with one-word answers and 
<br>left for work.

Joe&#x27;s wife came home from work in a good mood 
<br>and asked Joe if he wanted to go for a walk. While walking she told him how she had resolved the 
<br>previous day&#x27;s problem. Joe revealed to his wife how uncomfortable it had made him to not try to fix her 
<br>problem the previous evening. She responded by telling Joe that she didn&#x27;t want him to try to fix her 
<br>problems and that she liked it better that he had given her some space to work it out on her own.

<br>encourage them to take a different approach when beginning new relationships. Relationships are messy 
<br>and there is no way to eliminate the bumps and potholes, but we don&#x27;t have to make them any more 
<br>difficult than they already are. This is one area where I strongly encourage Nice Guys to </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">do something 
<br>different.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> That is, enter relationships with a healthy agenda, rather than an unconscious, dysfunctional 
<br>one.

<br>Because they don&#x27;t know why a healthy or independent person would want them, they settle for a 
<br>diamond in the rough. They tend to pick partners who have had troubled childhoods, are sexual abuse 
<br>survivors, have had a string of bad relationships, are depressed, are having money problems, are 
<br>overweight, or are struggling single moms. Then they go to work operating from a covert contract â 
<br>fixing, caretaking, and pleasing â all with the hope that she will turn out to be a polished gem. 
<br>Unfortunately, this strategy rarely works.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:93675px; width:580px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">When recovering Nice Guys create relationships with people who don&#x27;t need fixing, they improve their 
<br>odds of finding the love they want. This doesn&#x27;t mean searching for the </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">perfect</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> partner, just one who is 
<br>already taking responsibility for her own life. Over time, the members of my No More Mr. Nice Guy! 
<br>groups have come up with a number of traits to </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">consciously</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> look for when creating new relationships. 
<br>These traits include (in no particular order):

<br>well by this list (especially if it is the Nice Guy doing the evaluating). That doesn&#x27;t mean they need to 
<br>jump out of the relationship and go looking for greener pastures. Instead, I encourage these men to first 
<br>begin addressing their own behaviors and look at why they needed to create the kind of relationship they 
<br>have with their present partner.

I 
<br>have found that when recovering Nice Guys begin dealing with their own dysfunctional patterns, their 
<br>relationships also begin changing. At times these changes cause them to reevaluate their desire to get 
<br>out. Sometimes they confirm it is time for a change.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:94104px; width:568px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Nice Guys have a strong tendency to try to do everything &quot;right.&quot; This list isn&#x27;t meant as a magic 
<br>formula. There are no perfect people and no perfect relationships. But by consciously looking for the 
<br>traits listed above in a prospective partner, Nice Guys can save themselves a lot of grief and improve 
<br>their chances of actually finding what they are looking for.

<br>must give themselves a chance to accurately evaluate the traits listed above by staying out of bed with a 
<br>person until they really get to know her. Once the sex begins in relationships, the learning stops. Sex 
<br>creates such a powerful bond that it is difficult to accurately evaluate the appropriateness of a new

<br>many ways, but the most common are:

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Vagiphobia</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> to describe this propensity. Vagiphobia is a syndrome where the penis tries to stay out of 
<br>vaginas or gets out quickly once it is in. While this survival mechanism may help protect the Nice Guy 
<br>from having to experience his shame and fear, it also guarantees he won&#x27;t have very much sex.

Alan began therapy due to a problematic habit of entering 
<br>into sexualized relationships outside of his marriage. Some of these trysts became overtly sexual, yet 
<br>none were ever consummated with intercourse. The problem came to a head after he began a

In social situations he always felt more 
<br>comfortable connecting with women. Over time, it became apparent that due to childhood conditioning 
<br>â a monogamous bond with his mother, the decision to be different from his father, and the effects of 
<br>fundamentalist religious teachings â Alan found creative ways to get the attention of women while 
<br>avoiding putting his penis in their vaginas. (I refer to this common Nice Guy behavior as &quot;flirting 
<br>without fucking.&quot; As long as the Nice Guy doesn&#x27;t put his penis in a vagina, he can exchange all kinds of 
<br>sexual energy yet convince himself he hasn&#x27;t really had sex or hasn&#x27;t done anything wrong.)
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:97921px; width:589px; height:131px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">On one occasion, Alan shared an example with his No More Mr. Nice Guy! group of this behavior. Alan 
<br>had been on a business trip, traveling with a co-worker, a young woman whom Alan found very 
<br>attractive. During the trip, they flirted and exchanged sexual innuendoes. One evening, they sat in the 
<br>bar and talked about their lives. The evening ended with some slow dancing. The next evening after 
<br>drinks, the woman invited Alan to join her in the hot tub. She showed up in a revealing string bikini. 
<br>While in the hot tub, she sat on Alan&#x27;s lap and they kissed passionately. Even though he was very 
<br>aroused, he turned down her offer to go up to her room because he didn&#x27;t want to &quot;jeopardize their 
<br>working relationship.&quot;

Alan had a couple of girlfriends in 
<br>high school. But whenever the girls got serious and wanted to move beyond petting, Alan felt smothered 
<br>and broke up.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:98144px; width:587px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Alan portrayed his wife as being sexually withdrawn. One factor that contributed to this situation was 
<br>that Alan would never directly initiate sex. He believed women thought sex was bad and he was 
<br>convinced that if he was too direct in letting them know he wanted to have sex, they would think </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">he</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> was 
<br>bad.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:98230px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Alan used his frustration over his wife&#x27;s sexual unavailability to justify his sexualized behavior with 
<br>other women. Interestingly enough, Alan had a consistent knack of only flirting with women that weren&#x27;t 
<br>very likely to be available to consummate a relationship with him. On the rare occasion that he guessed 
<br>wrong, Alan would find some good reason to not follow through with what he had started.

Being a good lover can be an 
<br>attachment these men use to feel valuable. It can be a way to convince themselves they are different 
<br>from other men. It can also be a very effective mechanism for allowing them to have sex while staying 
<br>distracted from their internalized shame and fear. As long as they are focused on the arousal and 
<br>pleasure of their partner, Nice Guys can distract themselves from their own toxic shame, feelings of 
<br>inadequacy, or fear of being smothered. Terrance, a Nice Guy in his mid-thirties is a good example.

<br>therapy session. &quot;My first wife left me for another man,&quot; he continued without pausing. &quot;That was 
<br>devastating. The good news is, I met a wonderful, sensual, sexual woman, and we&#x27;re engaged to get 
<br>married. There&#x27;s only one problem. I come too fast. She turns me on so much, I just get too excited.&quot;

<br>Whenever they had sex, Terrance would try to make sure his girlfriend had two or three orgasms by 
<br>stimulating her orally before he put his penis inside her vagina. He then tried to bring her to one more 
<br>climax vaginally. Unfortunately, he frequently ejaculated before she had her final orgasm. Terrance was 
<br>so seemingly selfless that he told his fiancÃ©e that he didn&#x27;t care if he never had an orgasm, as long as she 
<br>was satisfied.

Her parents love me. 
<br>She says she loves everything about me, except she feels like 30 percent is missing. She doesn&#x27;t seem to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">want to make love anymore and is talking about postponing the wedding until I can get this thing fixed.&quot;

<br>to be great lovers. When Nice Guys set out to be great lovers, they are actually creating a recipe for 
<br>boring sex. Sex that focuses on trying to please the other guarantees a routine, do-what-worked-last-time 
<br>kind of experience. Trying to be a great lover pretty much insures that a Nice Guy will not have many 
<br>passionate, reciprocal, spontaneous, serendipitous, or intimate sexual experiences â hardly a recipe for 
<br>good sex!

<br>of worthlessness, smooth over conflict, create feelings of being loved, relieve stress, and generally solve 
<br>all personal problems. Nice Guys believe such a drug exists â they call it sex.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:99122px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Many Nice Guys discovered at an early age that sexual arousal was a good distraction from the isolation, 
<br>turmoil, unrealistic demands, and abandonment experiences of their childhood. Unfortunately, when 
<br>Nice Guys bring their sensual security blanket into adulthood, it prevents them from experiencing 
<br>intimate and fulfilling sex with another individual.

I have developed a theory 
<br>that states, </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">the nicer the guy, the darker the sexual secrets.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> I find this to be consistently true. Sex is a 
<br>basic human drive. Because most Nice Guys believe they are bad for being sexual, or believe that other 
<br>people will think they are bad, sexual impulses have to be kept hidden from view. The Nice Guy&#x27;s 
<br>sexuality doesn&#x27;t go away, it just goes underground. Therefore, the more dependent a man is on external 
<br>approval, the deeper he is going to have to hide his sexual behavior.

<br>Everybody liked Lyle. He was one of those guys who didn&#x27;t seem to have any rough edges. A devout

There was only one hitch â he was secretly addicted to pornography. 
<br>Growing up in an Evangelical Christian home, he first discovered this drug when he was nine. A loner

<br>pornography, he never felt alone.

Over the years his compulsive 
<br>behavior expanded to renting adult videos, visiting peep shows and strip bars, and calling 900 numbers. 
<br>Most recently, his obsession had found flight in cyberspace. Frequenting sex chat rooms he carried on a 
<br>number of sexual relationships with faceless surfers on the Internet.

She 
<br>would protest that it just wasn&#x27;t normal to go months without having sex. Lyle would validate her

<br>behavior that there was little left for a real, person-to-person sexual relationship.

<br>opposite sex. If he is to have any hope of securing a girlfriend and someday having sex, he must figure 
<br>out what it takes to get a female to notice him and approve of him. For some boys this process seems to 
<br>come fairly easily. If they happen to be good-looking, a star athlete, or from an affluent family, 
<br>attracting females may not be overly difficult for them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100040px; width:591px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Once you exclude the minority of adolescent males listed above, that leaves the majority of teenage boys 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:13px">who have no clue of what it will take to get a girl to like them. It is at this point that many young men 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">decide that maybe by being &quot;nice,&quot; they will stand out from the other guys and might gain the approval 
<br>of some member of the opposite sex. This decision is especially important if the young man has already 
<br>been conditioned to believe that he is not OK just as he is.

<br>woman would be lucky to have them while simultaneously wondering why any woman would want 
<br>them. Because they can&#x27;t think of any other reason why a woman would be attracted to them or want to 
<br>have sex with them, Nice Guys hang on to their strategy of &quot;being nice&quot; even when it consistently 
<br>proves ineffective in getting them the sex they want.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100378px; width:588px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Ironically, trying to be nice robs a man of his life energy. The more a Nice Guy seeks approval and tries 
<br>to &quot;do it right,&quot; the tighter he clamps a lid down on any kind of energy that might actually draw a person 
<br>to him. This is why I frequently hear Nice Guys lament about women not being attracted to them. The 
<br>problem is, once they have repressed all of their life energy, there is little about them to get anyone&#x27;s 
<br>attention or turn them on.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100481px; width:581px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Women consistently tell me that even though they may be initially drawn to a Nice Guy&#x27;s pleasing 
<br>demeanor, over time they find it difficult to get excited about having sex with him. Often the partner 
<br>feels defective, but it is really not her fault. There is just very little about the Nice Guy persona to flip a 
<br>switch or arouse a prospective partner. Once again, by doing the opposite of what works, Nice Guys 
<br>prevent themselves from getting the sex they want.

<br>When she would say &quot;no&quot; he would pout and withdraw. When she did consent to being sexual he would 
<br>focus on her arousal while she did little to reciprocate. With pithy awareness she revealed, &quot;I could tell 
<br>him it would really turn me on if he set himself on fire. He would gladly do it and think he was getting 
<br>good sex because it made me happy.&quot;

Aaron 
<br>provides a good example of a pretty common way Nice Guys create bad sex. Let&#x27;s visit his bedroom and 
<br>observe a typical sexual scenario between him and his wife Hannah.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100802px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Aaron and Hannah haven&#x27;t had sex in several weeks, a common occurrence in their relationship. 
<br>Tonight, Aaron is feeling sexual, but instead of telling Hannah that he wants to make love, he goes into a 
<br>pattern of indirectly trying to arouse her. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100872px; width:581px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Even though Hannah has let Aaron know on several occasions she resents his &quot;pestering,&quot; he moves up 
<br>behind her in bed and begins to rub her back. As he massages her shoulders he momentarily tunes out 
<br>his resentment over her sexual unavailability. As he slowly moves his hands down to rub her buttocks, 
<br>he also tunes out that her body is totally unreceptive to his touch. He hopes that by moving slowly and 
<br>not alarming her by being too overtly sexual, she will get in the mood. This approach has occasionally 
<br>worked in the past.

<br>his own body. By now, he is focused on Hannah&#x27;s arousal and trying to anticipate how to stimulate her 
<br>just enough to get her in the mood without doing too much to make her angry.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:101186px; width:590px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Finally, because she hasn&#x27;t rebuffed his advances, he rolls her over and for the next twenty minutes 
<br>focuses all of his attention on her arousal until she has an orgasm. Since he is disconnected from his own 
<br>physical arousal, he has a difficult time climaxing himself. To help himself along, he fantasizes about 
<br>the young secretary at work. When he finally has an orgasm, he immediately shifts his focus back to his 
<br>wife to check in on her emotional state. Later, as he rolls over and goes to sleep, Aaron feels empty and 
<br>resentful.

<br>sexual shame and fear out of the closet. Lyle was a good Christian, husband, and father who struggled 
<br>with compulsive sexual behavior. Everything came crashing down for Lyle when his wife found a phone 
<br>bill and called some of the strange numbers. She was bewildered and devastated. Never in her wildest 
<br>dreams (or nightmares) did she think that Lyle might be involved in anything like pornography or phone 
<br>sex. Little did she know she had just discovered the tip of the iceberg. Confronted with the evidence, 
<br>Lyle initially feigned surprise and denied any knowledge of its origin. Finally, he broke down and told 
<br>all. Well, almost all. It took several more weeks, several more emotional confrontations, and a call to me 
<br>before everything came out.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:103053px; width:591px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">After a couple of sessions of individual therapy, I suggested that Lyle start attending a 12-step group for 
<br>sexual addicts. This idea initially terrified Lyle, but he knew he would have to do something radically 
<br>different if he wanted to free himself of his compulsion and experience true sexual intimacy. To his 
<br>surprise, revealing his long-kept secrets in the presence of other recovering sex addicts wasn&#x27;t as difficult 
<br>as he feared. In time, he began to look forward to the opportunity to talk about himself with safe people. 
<br>Every time he revealed some secret thought or act, he felt a sense of relief, as if a weight had been lifted 
<br>from his shoulders.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:103190px; width:584px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As Lyle revealed his fear and shame to safe people, he found that he was less interested in his hidden, 
<br>compulsive behaviors. As he and his wife became more open and intimate with each other, he also 
<br>began to enjoy a physical closeness with her that he had once tried to avoid. When Lyle came out of the 
<br>closet, he began to heal a lifetime of hidden sexual behavior.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:103276px; width:590px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In my No More Mr. Nice Guy! groups I encourage recovering Nice Guys to bring their sexual shame out 
<br>of the closet. I support them in talking explicitly about their sexuality. In our culture, most sex talk is 
<br>done in pornographic, demeaning, moralizing, shaming, clinical, or joking ways. I invite recovering 
<br>Nice Guys to reveal the ways they act out. I have them talk about their sexual history and early sexual 
<br>experiences. I ask them to bring samples of pornography they find arousing. This is another way of 
<br>releasing shame while also gaining important information.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:103396px; width:585px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Throughout the entire process of revealing themselves, I encourage recovering Nice Guys to experience 
<br>whatever they may be feeling â shame, guilt, fear, arousal. At the same time, I give them supportive 
<br>messages that what they are feeling is OK. There are so many negative messages in our society about 
<br>male sexuality, it is difficult for Nice Guys to overcome their conditioning without this kind of 
<br>encouragement and support.

<br>especially true with sex. When recovering Nice Guys decide to take responsibility for their own needs 
<br>and take matters into their own hands, they put themselves in a position to get the quantity and quality of 
<br>sex they want. Let me explain.

<br>effective way to change a behavior is to change its smallest elements. For example, if a Nice Guys is not 
<br>getting as much sex as he wants or isn&#x27;t getting the kind of sex he wants, the only way to change this 
<br>behavior pattern is to change its smallest components. Rather than going out and trying to have more 
<br>sex, it is more effective to change the little things that create the overall pattern of not getting much sex. 
<br>Change the little things, and the big picture changes as a result.

Healthy 
<br>masturbation is a process of letting sexual energy unfold. It has no goal or destination. It&#x27;s not just about 
<br>orgasms. It does not require outside stimulation from pornography and doesn&#x27;t use trances or fantasy to 
<br>stay distracted from shame and fear. It is about learning to pay attention to what feels good. Most of all, 
<br>it is about accepting sole responsibility for one&#x27;s sexual pleasure and expression.

The concept 
<br>seems like an oxymoron. In general, Nice Guys have tremendous internalized shame around 
<br>masturbation. They also frequently surround themselves with people who reinforce this shame (partner, 
<br>religion, etc.). Many Nice Guys also struggle with compulsive masturbation. They fear that attempting 
<br>any kind of self-gratification might open up Pandora&#x27;s Box.

<br>using fantasy or pornography there is no way for their behavior to become compulsive. I have also found 
<br>that when they share the experience with other non-judgmental men, their shame diminishes rapidly.

<br>to kill it. Fantasizing during sex makes about as much sense as thinking about a Big Mac while

<br>break up with him. In the first several sessions, I focused on the subject of him making his needs a 
<br>priority. As with most Nice Guys, this initially made him uncomfortable (to put it mildly). Terrance was 
<br>terrified that if he wasn&#x27;t a great lover and didn&#x27;t keep his girlfriend happy, she would leave him like his 
<br>ex-wife did.

<br>regularly that this would make him more attractive to his fiancÃ©e, not less. As he began to discover that 
<br>making his needs a priority didn&#x27;t drive his girlfriend away, we took it to the next step. I talked with 
<br>Terrance about healthy masturbation. I encouraged him to find a time when he would be undisturbed in 
<br>which he could focus on his own pleasure and arousal. I suggested that he do this without having a goal 
<br>of climaxing and without using fantasy or pornography. I encouraged him to pay attention to what felt 
<br>good to him and to observe the ways he unconsciously tried to distract himself from his shame and fear.

The first time he tried it he reported not 
<br>feeling &quot;much of anything.&quot; I encouraged him to continue the assignment at least once a week. After a

We talked 
<br>about Terrance taking his focus off her arousal and orgasms and beginning to focus more on himself. 
<br>His girlfriend actually expressed relief. She revealed that it felt like a burden when Terrance expected 
<br>her to have multiple orgasms. Instead of telling him this in the past, she had just faked it.

They actually 
<br>began spending more time talking with each other about what they liked and didn&#x27;t like while they were 
<br>having sex. Even though it was initially difficult, Terrance shared with his fiancÃ©e what he had found out 
<br>about himself from his own healthy masturbation. He was surprised when she expressed interest in 
<br>pleasuring him and having a reciprocal sexual relationship with him.

It has no goal. It 
<br>is free of agendas and expectations. Rather than being a performance, it is an unfolding of sexual energy. 
<br>It is about two people revealing themselves in the most intimate and vulnerable of ways. Good sex 
<br>occurs when two people focus on their own pleasure, passion, and arousal, and stay connected to those 
<br>same things in their partner. All of these dynamics allow good sex to unfold in unpredictable, 
<br>spontaneous, and memorable ways.

<br>sex. For the first few weeks in the No More Mr. Nice Guy! group, Aaron vented his frustrations and 
<br>shared how helpless he felt to get Hannah to want to have sex with him. It was obvious that Aaron 
<br>believed his wife held the key to his sexual happiness and that he was angry over her willful refusal to 
<br>use that key. As a result, he felt &quot;rejected&quot; and &quot;worthless.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:107477px; width:588px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">After a few weeks, I suggested that Aaron go on a sexual moratorium in which he refrained from having 
<br>sex with Hannah for a period of six months. During this time I suggested that he focus on doing things 
<br>he had given up when he and Hannah got married. I also encouraged him to tell Hannah whatever he 
<br>was feeling. I shared with him that a sexual moratorium would make it easier for him to do these things 
<br>because he wouldn&#x27;t be so concerned about maintaining the possibility of her availability. If they weren&#x27;t 
<br>having sex, he wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about doing something that might make her angry and cause her 
<br>to withhold sex.

<br>I told him the goal was not to get her to have more sex, but for him to reclaim his key and stop feeling 
<br>like a victim. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:107683px; width:575px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Even though he was initially hesitant, he acknowledged that he wasn&#x27;t having much sex anyway. With 
<br>the support of the men in the group, Aaron decided to go home that night and tell his wife what he 
<br>planned to do.

<br>angry, but over the course of the week, had acted more loving toward him than she had in months.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:107917px; width:588px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Over the next six months, Aaron shared his experiences with the group. On several occasions he 
<br>reported doing things for himself that previously would have created tremendous anxiety. He went out 
<br>with some guy friends he hadn&#x27;t seen in a couple of years. He began to share his feelings with his wife. 
<br>On more than one occasion, this included telling her when he was angry at her. He even let her know on 
<br>a couple of occasions when he wasn&#x27;t in the mood to listen to her talk about her problems. He also found 
<br>that he became more honest â revealing things to her that he had previously kept to himself.

She revealed to him that 
<br>since he was not pursuing her, she felt freer to move toward him. She also expressed that she liked being 
<br>able to have sexual energy with Aaron, without it always having to end up in intercourse.

He also discovered 
<br>how to get his needs met and express his feelings more directly, instead of through sex. Most 
<br>importantly, when he and Hannah did start having sex again, he felt much more connected to his wife.

<br>when a seemingly unavailable partner expresses a desire to be sexual. One client, who hadn&#x27;t had sex 
<br>with his wife in 14 months, shared in a Nice Guy group that he was tired of listening to his wife 
<br>complain about her work problems. That night, for the first time in 15 years of marriage, he told his wife 
<br>that he was too tired to listen. Even though she was initially angry, later that night she asked him if he 
<br>wanted to make love.

<br>dysfunctional, unsatisfying relationships are often the same dynamics that keep them stuck in 
<br>dysfunctional and unsatisfying vocations.

They don&#x27;t believe they deserve to have 
<br>good things. They find all kinds of ways to make sure their view of the world is never challenged. They 
<br>settle for scraps and think it is all they deserve. They create all kinds of rationalizations to explain why 
<br>they will never have what they really desire. Because of their self-fulfilling beliefs, Nice Guys rarely 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">live up to their potential or get what they really want in life.

<br>the Life They Want
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:114089px; width:572px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As stated in previous chapters, two major factors prevent Nice Guys from getting what they want in 
<br>love. The first is that they tend to recreate familiar, yet dissatisfying relationships. They find partners 
<br>who will help them create the same dysfunctional kinds of relationships they experienced as children. 
<br>These men then frequently see themselves as being victims to the dysfunction of their partners. Nice 
<br>Guys have a difficult time seeing that they were attracted to these people for a reason.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:114192px; width:572px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Second, Nice Guys rarely experience the kind of relationships they want because they are bad enders. 
<br>When a healthy person would pack up and move on, Nice Guys just keep doing more of the same, 
<br>hoping that something will miraculously change.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:114262px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Nice Guys aren&#x27;t much different in their jobs. They are attracted to careers and work situations that allow 
<br>them to recreate the dysfunctional roles, relationships, and rules of their childhood. They often see 
<br>themselves as helpless victims to these situations. Rarely do they see why they need these systems to be 
<br>the way they are and that they have the choice to leave.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:114348px; width:574px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Unconsciously recreating familiar family patterns in their jobs and careers keeps Nice Guys stuck and 
<br>dissatisfied. While they are perpetuating the dysfunction of their childhood, they rarely do what they 
<br>really want or rise to the top of their chosen vocation.

<div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:114589px; width:582px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I frequently tell the men in my No More Mr. Nice Guy! groups that my goal is for every one of them to 
<br>leave the group a millionaire. This statement really has very little to do with money or material wealth 
<br>â it is about discovering passion and living up to potential.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:114658px; width:581px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As stated above, the Nice Guys I counsel are generally intelligent, talented men. As these men work on 
<br>recovering from the Nice Guy Syndrome, they begin to accept themselves just as they are. This 
<br>acceptance of the self allows them to embrace their passions and face their fears.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:114727px; width:587px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The formation of a more accurate view of the self and the world allows the abundance of the universe to 
<br>begin flowing freely into their lives. Sometimes this takes the form of money. Sometimes it takes the 
<br>form of love. Sometimes it takes the form of sex. Sometimes it takes the form of the bright lights of 
<br>fame. Sometimes it includes all of the above.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:114814px; width:579px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The remainder of this chapter presents a strategy to help recovering Nice Guys become all they can be. 
<br>The following pages present a plan that has already helped countless Nice Guys discover their passion 
<br>and live up to their potential. It can do the same for you.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:114929px; width:588px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Charlie could have been the poster child for passionless, underachieving Nice Guys. When I first met 
<br>Charlie he was stuck in a job he hated and living a life characterized by mediocrity and fear. Charlie had 
<br>completed his engineering degree a couple of years before, yet he was still working at the same job he 
<br>had held before starting college. Charlie&#x27;s employers had promised him a big promotion upon 
<br>graduation. When they failed to keep their promise, Charlie just stifled his resentment and kept on doing 
<br>the same old thing he had always done.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:115049px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Charlie&#x27;s single passion was flying. In spite of warnings of disaster from his mother, he had begun taking 
<br>flying lessons after he finished college. Though Charlie dreamed of earning his pilot&#x27;s license, he never 
<br>seemed to be able to complete the necessary requirements to achieve his goal.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:115119px; width:584px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">A woman at his work introduced Charlie to my website. When he read the description of a Nice Guy he 
<br>was mortified. He couldn&#x27;t figure out how someone could know him so well. It took him six months 
<br>before he worked up the nerve to send me an email. It took him another two months to send me a 
<br>second. From the first time Charlie looked at my website he knew he needed to join a men&#x27;s group, but 
<br>the idea of being that vulnerable terrified him.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:115222px; width:584px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">It was at that point that Charlie made a decision that changed his life. Charlie decided that if something 
<br>frightened him that much, he needed to face his fear and do it. Little did he know then, but that decision 
<br>was just the beginning of a journey that would lead Charlie toward the rediscovery of his passion and 
<br>purpose in life.

<br>that fear. Charlie&#x27;s progress was slow but steady. Basically, he crawled until he could walk. He took 
<br>baby steps until he could run. Once he got going, there was no stopping him.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:115500px; width:571px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Over the period of about eighteen months Charlie took several steps toward rediscovering his passion 
<br>and purpose in life.

<br>Guy! group. Initially, when there was no agenda or goal, my writing was a spontaneous recording of my 
<br>growing insight into the Nice Guy Syndrome. Before long, clients and family members began 
<br>suggesting that I write a book. It seemed like a logical extension of what I was already doing so the idea 
<br>made perfect sense.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:118610px; width:589px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">It was at that time that something began to change. Rather than being just a few insights and illustrations 
<br>written for the benefit of a handful of clients, my effort became directed at producing something that 
<br>would be deserving of publication and widespread distribution. I began hearing people suggest things 
<br>like &quot;bestseller,&quot; &quot;Oprah,&quot; and &quot;get rich.&quot;

<br>question I was asked by friends and family during this time was &quot;When are you going to finish your 
<br>book?&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:118947px; width:584px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Over the years the manuscript went through at least three major revisions as well as extensive editing. 
<br>Numerous factors contributed to the length of time it took to finish the book, but the number one reason 
<br>was that I thought it had to be </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">perfect.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> I thought the book had to be perfect to be published. I thought it 
<br>had to be perfect for anyone to buy it. It thought it had to be perfect for it to help anyone.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">write everything I knew about the Nice Guy Syndrome! The original manuscript of this book was 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">probably four times its present length. I believed I had to be an eloquent writer. I believed the text had to 
<br>be flawless.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:119119px; width:556px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I went to therapy to find out why I couldn&#x27;t finish my book. My children became disillusioned, 
<br>predicting that I never would finish. My wife half-seriously threatened to leave me if I didn&#x27;t finish.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:119172px; width:585px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Finally, after years of frustration, I had a breakthrough. A very wise person suggested that I give myself 
<br>permission to never publish the book. I felt an immediate sense of relief.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:119224px; width:589px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I realized that I had gotten away from my original goal â to write a few insights that would help a few 
<br>men live better lives. Once I let go of the burden of having to get published, be a best-selling author, and 
<br>appear on Oprah, everything changed. I went back to my original agenda. From then on when I wrote, I 
<br>only asked myself one thing: &quot;Will this help my clients find answers to their problems?&quot; I also kept 
<br>reminding myself that my clients would never get a chance to benefit from my insight if I never finished 
<br>the book.

I 
<br>completed the book. Clients reported that it was changing their lives. Therapists began to request copies 
<br>for their clients. Radio talk show hosts and newspaper and magazine writers began contacting me for 
<br>interviews. I hired an agent. Publishers began pursuing me.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;good enough&quot; set me free to embrace my passion and create something of lasting value. This same

He seemed to have a lot of things going for him: He was good looking, 
<br>intelligent, outgoing, and funny. Yet Phil always seemed to fall way short of achieving his lofty goals 
<br>and dreams. A number of things got in the way â taking shortcuts, procrastination, and insecurities 
<br>about whether he deserved to get what he really wanted.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120128px; width:578px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Perhaps Phil&#x27;s greatest roadblock was his difficulty asking people for help. Phil had a number of faulty 
<br>core beliefs about people helping him. He didn&#x27;t believe he deserved to get what he wanted. He didn&#x27;t 
<br>believe his needs were important to other people. He believed the surest way </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">not</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> to get his needs met 
<br>was to ask in clear and direct ways.

<br>relationship with his wife. I asked Phil if he asked his wife to have sex with him. He said &quot;no.&quot; I asked 
<br>him if he believed his wife wanted to have sex with him. To this he also replied in the negative.

<br>thinking his needs were important and not believing that other people wanted to help him meet his 
<br>needs. I suggested that changing his beliefs about his sexual needs might be the place to begin changing 
<br>core beliefs that prevented him from having other things he wanted in life.

<br>shared in his enthusiasm. They wanted to know how it happened. &quot;I asked,&quot; was Phil&#x27;s simple reply. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120535px; width:580px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I questioned Phil how his wife felt about having sex with him. &quot;She was fine about it,&quot; he replied. &quot;She 
<br>said she likes having sex with me, but that I hadn&#x27;t asked in a long time so she didn&#x27;t think I was 
<br>interested.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120605px; width:586px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">A week later, Phil told the group he was dreading asking his father-in-law to borrow money to get the 
<br>old single-pane windows replaced on his house. Some of the group members began asking questions 
<br>about the cost. Some shared that they had done that kind of project before. I suggested that Phil ask the 
<br>group to help him. It was like pulling teeth, but Phil asked the men if they would help him replace his 
<br>windows. The members of the group responded unanimously that they would be glad to. About a month 
<br>later the men got together at Phil&#x27;s house and had the equivalent of an old fashion barn-raising.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120724px; width:586px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">These two experiences had a tremendous impact on Phil. He began to see that his needs were important, 
<br>that people wanted to help him meet his needs, and that the surest way of getting people to help was to 
<br>ask.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120794px; width:573px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Phil began to build on this new paradigm. Within a few weeks he shared a plan with the group to start 
<br>his own business. A friend of the family had offered to help him get started in his own landscaping 
<br>business. This prospect especially excited him because the seasonal work would allow him to teach 
<br>snowboarding during the winter â a life long dream.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120880px; width:575px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">An old friend offered to be his financial backer. His wife volunteered to look for a job that paid health 
<br>insurance benefits. Men in the group offered to help him write a business plan and set up his 
<br>bookkeeping.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120949px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As long as Phil tried to do everything himself, he struggled to get what he wanted. Once he started 
<br>asking for help and letting people be there for him, his life began to turn around. He is now headed in the 
<br>direction of creating the kind of life and vocation he has always dreamed of.

<br>life. They waste time, they procrastinate, they start things but don&#x27;t finish, they spend too much time 
<br>fixing other people&#x27;s problems, they distract themselves with trivial pursuits, they create chaos, they 
<br>make excuses.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:121630px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Sal is a good example of this. Sal was raised by a passive father and a schizophrenic mother. Neither 
<br>parent was available to pay attention to him or meet his needs. At a young age he had to take 
<br>responsibility for the welfare of his younger brother. Sal had virtually no options as a child. When he felt 
<br>frightened or overwhelmed, he would just hunker down and trudge ahead with dogged determination.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:121716px; width:589px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As an adult, Sal ran a body shop for his uncle. His uncle was a cheap, shortsighted, marginally involved 
<br>business owner. It was Sal&#x27;s job to create a profitable business with the limited resources and dissatisfied 
<br>employees his uncle provided. (Sal actually operated on the assumption that this feat could be 
<br>successfully accomplished!)

<br>quiet the stress headache created by trying to negotiate an impossible situation at work. On one occasion 
<br>I asked Sal if he wanted to explore options for his work situation. &quot;What&#x27;s the use?&quot; he replied. &quot;There&#x27;s 
<br>nothing that can be done.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:121889px; width:583px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">For about fifteen minutes, group members asked questions and proposed options. Sal looked like a man 
<br>undergoing a root canal with no anesthetic.

There is 
<br>no way it could ever happen though. I&#x27;d have to work evenings and weekends. My wife just wouldn&#x27;t go

His eyes reflected a 
<br>terror as if he was being interrogated by Gestapo agents with cattle prods and ice picks. When it became 
<br>apparent that exploring possible options only aggravated his fear and caused him to shut down further, 
<br>the group members mercifully backed off. Later, Sal referred to the experience as &quot;being reamed by the 
<br>group.&quot;

<br>actions, Sal all but guaranteed that he would never experience any kind of success or satisfaction in his 
<br>job. It was much more familiar and comfortable to stay stuck in a stressful, no-win situation.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:122706px; width:577px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Every Nice Guy with whom I have worked has at some point had to make a conscious decision to stop 
<br>sabotaging himself. This is a crucial aspect in recovery from the Nice Guy Syndrome. In order to start 
<br>getting what they want in life, work, and career, recovering Nice Guys have to make the conscious 
<br>decision to get out of their own way.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:122792px; width:561px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:13px">One way of doing this is by changing the way they think about change. This begins with Nice Guys 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">becoming aware of why they unconsciously create so many barriers that keep them feeling stuck. A 
<br>mortgage, a wife, a lack of a degree, debt, children â are all just excuses. Making significant life 
<br>changes doesn&#x27;t require chucking all these things. It means seeing them for what they really are â 
<br>excuses â and taking small steps in the direction one wants to be going.

<br>They tend to see the goodies as being in short supply. They hang on tightly to what they&#x27;ve got, fearing 
<br>there won&#x27;t be more when it is gone. They believe they have to control and manipulate to ensure that

As a successful salesman, 
<br>Russell earned a comfortable six-figure income. He religiously put forty percent of his take home pay 
<br>into savings and investments. He kept a minimum balance of $30,000 in his checking account. In spite 
<br>of his ability to create financial wealth, Russell was controlled by his deprivation thinking. Russell was 
<br>so afraid of financial ruin that he would not allow his wife to buy a $9.00 video for his children at 
<br>Costco if it wasn&#x27;t in the budget.

<br>His father was miserly and rigid. He seemed to single Russell out for critical treatment, while heaping 
<br>praise and favor on his two brothers. Later, before he died, his father cut Russell out of his will and gave 
<br>Russell&#x27;s share to the church. It is no wonder that Russell viewed the world through lenses clouded by 
<br>deprivation.

<br>making others happy. Nice Guys avoid conflict like the plague and will go to great lengths to avoid 
<br>upsetting anyone. In general, Nice Guys are peaceful and generous. Nice Guys are especially concerned 
<br>about pleasing women and being different from other men. In a nutshell, </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys believe that if they 
<br>are good, giving, and caring, they will in return be happy, loved, and fulfilled.

<br>practice as a psychotherapist. These passively pleasing men struggle in vain to experience the happiness 
<br>they so desperately crave and believe they deserve. This frustration is due to the fact that </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys 
<br>have believed a myth.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">belief that if Nice Guys are &quot;good,&quot; they will be loved, get their needs met, and live a problem-free life. 
<br>When this life strategy fails to produce the desired results â as it often does â Nice Guys usually just 
<br>try harder, doing more of the same. Due to the sense of helplessness and resentment this pattern 
<br>inevitably produces, Nice Guys are often anything but nice.

<br>never getting back what I believed I deserved. I was the typical &quot;sensitive new age guy&quot; â and proud of 
<br>it. I believed I was one of the nicest guys you would ever meet. Yet I wasn&#x27;t happy.

<br>introduction. Jason described his life as &quot;perfect&quot; â except for one major problem â his sex life. It had 
<br>been several months since he and his wife Heather had been sexual and it didn&#x27;t look like anything was 
<br>going to change soon.

<br>welcome the opportunity to talk about himself and his life.

<br>prided himself on not having many ups and downs and for never losing his temper. He revealed that he 
<br>liked to make people happy and that he hated conflict. To avoid rocking the boat with his wife, he 
<br>tended to hold back his feelings and tried to do everything &quot;right.&quot;

While doing 
<br>so, he stated that he had written a few things down so he wouldn&#x27;t forget them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:6406px; width:582px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;I can never do it right,&quot; Jason began, looking over his list. &quot;No matter how hard I try, Heather always 
<br>finds something wrong. I don&#x27;t deserve to be treated this way. I try to be a good husband and father, but 
<br>it&#x27;s never good enough.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:6476px; width:219px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Jason paused as he looked over his list.

<br>baby Chelsie up, fed her breakfast, gave her a bath. I had her all ready to go and was about to get ready 
<br>myself. Then Heather walked in and got that look on her face. I knew I was in trouble.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:6581px; width:583px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;&#x27;Why&#x27;d you dress her in that? That&#x27;s a </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">good</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> outfit.&#x27;&quot; Jason mimicked his wife&#x27;s tone. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know she 
<br>wanted Chelsie to wear something different. After everything I did to get her ready this morning, it was 
<br>still wrong.&quot;

<br>I loaded the dishwasher, did the pots and pans, and swept the floor. I thought Heather would really 
<br>appreciate all that I was doing to help out. Before I was finished, she walked in and asked, &#x27;How come

<br>married because we&#x27;re both Christians. Sex is real important to me, but Heather just isn&#x27;t interested. I 
<br>thought once you got married, everything was supposed to be great. After all I do for Heather, you&#x27;d 
<br>think she be willing to give me the one thing I really want.&quot;

It seems like I&#x27;m always giving so much more than I get.&quot; Now, looking 
<br>like a little boy on the couch, Jason pleaded, &quot;All I want is to be loved and appreciated. Is that too much 
<br>to ask?&quot;

Nevertheless, she complains that he is never

<br>Since Omar sees himself as such a giver, he can&#x27;t understand these accusations. Omar states that his 
<br>greatest joy in life is making other people happy. He even carries a pager so his friends can get in touch

He believes these traits set him apart 
<br>from other men and should attract women to him. Though he has many female friends, he rarely dates. 
<br>The women he knows tell him what a great listener he is and often call him to share their problems. He 
<br>likes feeling needed. These female friends constantly tell him what a great &quot;catch&quot; he will make for 
<br>some lucky woman. In spite of the way he treats women, he can&#x27;t understand why they all seem to be 
<br>attracted to jerks, rather than Nice Guys like him.

These traits are the result of a 
<br>script, often formed in childhood, that guides their lives. While other men may have one or two of these 
<br>traits, Nice Guys seem to possess a significant number. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:9071px; width:580px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are givers</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Nice Guys frequently state that it makes them feel good to give to others. These 
<br>men believe their generosity is a sign of how good they are and will make other people love and 
<br>appreciate them.

If a person has a problem, has a need, is angry, depressed or sad, Nice 
<br>Guys will frequently attempt to solve or fix the situation (usually without being asked).

A universal trait of the Nice Guy Syndrome is the seeking of 
<br>validation from others. Everything a Nice Guy does or says is at some level calculated to gain someone&#x27;s

Nice Guys seek to keep their world smooth. To do this, they avoid doing 
<br>things that might rock the boat or upset anyone.

These men are afraid that 
<br>others will get mad at them, shame them, or leave them if some mistake or shortcoming is exposed.

Nice Guys believe there is a key to having a happy,

<br>nothing should ever go wrong.

Nice Guys tend to analyze rather than feel. They may see feelings as 
<br>a waste of time and energy. They frequently try to keep their feelings on an even keel.

Many Nice Guys report having unavailable, 
<br>absent, passive, angry, philandering, or alcoholic fathers. It is not unusual for these men to make a 
<br>decision at some point in their lives to try to be 180 degrees different from Dad.

<br>conditioning, many Nice Guys have few male friends. Nice Guys frequently seek the approval of women 
<br>and convince themselves they are different from other men. They like to believe that they are not selfish, 
<br>angry, or abusive â traits they link to &quot;other&quot; men.

These men often feel that it is selfish to put 
<br>their needs first. They believe it is a virtue to put others&#x27; needs ahead of their own.

<br>only happy if their partner is happy. Therefore they will often focus tremendous energy on their intimate 
<br>relationships.

After all, how can being nice 
<br>be such a bad thing? We might even chuckle at the Marvin Milquetoast behaviors of these men as 
<br>portrayed in comic strips and television sitcoms. Since men already represent an easy target in our 
<br>culture, the caricature of a sensitive guy might be an object of amusement rather than concern.

<br>core belief system about themselves and the world around them. These men have been conditioned to 
<br>believe that if they are &quot;nice,&quot; they will be loved, get their needs met, and have a smooth life.

<br>some Not-So-Nice Traits of Nice Guys:
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10338px; width:565px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are dishonest</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. These men hide their mistakes, avoid conflict, say what they think people 
<br>want to hear, and repress their feelings. These traits make Nice Guys fundamentally dishonest.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10391px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are secretive.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Because they are so driven to seek approval, Nice Guys will hide anything that 
<br>they believe might upset anyone. The Nice Guy motto is, &quot;If at first you don&#x27;t succeed, hide the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">evidence.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10460px; width:583px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are compartmentalized.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Nice Guys are adept at harmonizing contradictory pieces of 
<br>information about themselves by separating them into individual compartments in their minds. 
<br>Therefore, a married man can create his own definition of fidelity which allows him to deny that he had 
<br>an affair with his secretary (or intern) because he never put his penis in her vagina.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10547px; width:590px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are manipulative</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Nice Guys tend to have a hard time making their needs a priority and 
<br>have difficulty asking for what they want in clear and direct ways. This creates a sense of powerlessness. 
<br>Therefore, they frequently resort to manipulation when trying to get their needs met.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10616px; width:582px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are controlling</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. A major priority for Nice Guys is keeping their world smooth. This creates 
<br>a constant need to try to control the people and things around them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10669px; width:550px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> </span><span style="font-family: Times-BoldItalic; font-size:14px">give to get</span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px"> </span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Though Nice Guys tend to be generous givers, their giving often has 
<br>unconscious and unspoken strings attached. They want to be appreciated, they want some kind of 
<br>reciprocation, they want someone to stop being angry at them, etc. Nice Guys often report feeling 
<br>frustrated or resentful as a result of giving so much while seemingly getting so little in return.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10755px; width:574px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are passive-aggressive</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Nice Guys tend to express their frustration and resentment in 
<br>indirect, roundabout, and not so nice ways. This includes being unavailable, forgetting, being late, not 
<br>following through, not being able to get an erection, climaxing too quickly, and repeating the same 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:13px">annoying behaviors even when they have promised to never do them again.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10841px; width:579px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are full of rage</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Though Nice Guys frequently deny ever getting angry, a lifetime of 
<br>frustration and resentment creates a pressure cooker of repressed rage deep inside these men. This rage 
<br>tends to erupt at some of the most unexpected and seemingly inappropriate times.

Addictive behavior serves the purpose of relieving stress, altering moods, or 
<br>medicating pain. Since Nice Guys tend to keep so much bottled up inside, it has to come out somewhere. 
<br>One of the most common addictive behaviors for Nice Guys is sexual compulsiveness.

Many Nice Guys have a hard time saying &quot;no,&quot; &quot;stop,&quot; 
<br>or &quot;I&#x27;m going to.&quot; They often feel like helpless victims and see the other person as the cause of the 
<br>problems they are experiencing.

Though Nice Guys desire to be liked and loved, their behaviors 
<br>actually make it difficult for people to get very close to them.

<br>they are outdated or inaccurate, they can send us in the wrong direction or fruitlessly driving around the 
<br>same old neighborhood. When this happens we often keep trying harder to find our desired destination 
<br>while feeling more and more frustrated. Even though an individual following an inaccurate or outdated 
<br>paradigm may think his behavior makes perfect sense, those around him may wonder what he could 
<br>possibly be thinking to make him act the way he does.

<br>based on the inaccurate interpretations of childhood experiences. Since they are often unconscious, they 
<br>are rarely evaluated or updated. Perhaps most significantly, they are assumed to be 100 percent accurate 
<br>â even when they are not.

<br>up his father&#x27;s expectations. Similarly, no matter how giving he was, his needy mother would never be

Like his 
<br>mother, his wife was only attentive when she was emotionally needy. Like his father, she could be 
<br>critical and controlling. By applying his childhood road map to his marriage â trying to do everything 
<br>right, being attentive and nurturing, never being a moment&#x27;s problem, hiding his mistakes â Jason 
<br>created an illusion that he could get his wife to approve of him all the time, be sexually available 
<br>whenever he wanted, and never get mad at him. His defective paradigm prevented him from seeing that 
<br>no matter what he did, his wife would still at times be cold, critical, and unavailable, </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">and</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> that maybe he 
<br>needed her to be that way. Even when his paradigm was just as ineffective in adulthood as it was in 
<br>childhood, Jason&#x27;s only option seemed to be to just keep trying harder.

<br>religious leader, or close friend. Since Nice Guys tend to seek out the approval of women, I strongly 
<br>encourage them to begin this process with men. For some Nice Guys, the concept of &quot;safe men&quot; may 
<br>seem like an oxymoron, but I highly recommend it anyway.

<br>occurred in the context of 12-step groups and therapy groups. Even though I am sure it is possible to

<br>The first is that the program of recovery presented in </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">No More Mr. Nice Guy!</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> is not just a few good

<br>If you are currently in a relationship, I encourage you to ask your partner to read this book along with 
<br>you. The program of recovery presented in </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">No More Mr. Nice Guy!</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> will significantly affect not only 
<br>you, but also those closest to you. Though your partner may be supportive of you making positive 
<br>changes, they may also initially frighten him or her. Reading this book together can help facilitate this 
<br>transition.

<br>their families and the world around them that it was not safe, acceptable, or desirable for them to be who 
<br>they were, just as they were.

In these first few 
<br>years a child&#x27;s personality is most significantly influenced by his surroundings. It is during this time that 
<br>his paradigms begin to be established. Since the strongest influences during this time are usually a 
<br>child&#x27;s parents and extended family, this is where we must begin our examination of the origins of the 
<br>Nice Guy Syndrome.

First, when children come into the 
<br>world they are </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">totally helpless</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. They are dependent on others to recognize and respond to their needs in 
<br>a timely, judicious manner. As a result of this dependency, every child&#x27;s greatest fear is abandonment. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">To children, abandonment means death.

This means that they inherently believe they are the center of the 
<br>universe and everything revolves around them. Therefore, they believe that they are the </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">cause</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> of

<br>to abandon them</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. They have no way of comprehending that their abandonment experiences are not

Since their insight, 
<br>experience, and resources are limited, these survival mechanisms are often ineffective and sometimes, 
<br>seemingly illogical. For instance, a child who is feeling lonely may misbehave in a way that is sure to 
<br>attract his parent&#x27;s attention in a negative way. Even though it may seem illogical for a child to do 
<br>something that invites painful or negative attention, the consequences of the behavior may not feel as 
<br>bad as feeling lonely or isolated.

<br>&quot;Leave It To Beaver,&quot; or &quot;All-American&quot; families. Nevertheless, these men learned to hide their flaws 
<br>and tried to become what they believed others wanted them to be. These factors indicate that at some

<br>are all unique in the way that their Nice Guy scripts are played out in their adult lives. In spite of these 
<br>differences, they all developed a core belief in childhood that they were not OK just as they were. As a 
<br>result of their internalized toxic shame, each developed a life paradigm that involved seeking approval 
<br>and hiding perceived flaws. All of these men believed that these life strategies were necessary if they 
<br>were to have any hope of being loved, getting their needs met, and having a problem-free life.

She had extreme mood swings and had a difficult time staying on 
<br>her medication. When she was manic, the house would be spotless, she would talk of entertaining 
<br>politicians and socialites, and she would begin destructive sexual relationships. When she was 
<br>depressed, she kept the windows covered, the house became a wreck, and she would threaten to kill 
<br>herself. When he was 15, Jose had to break through a locked door and take a loaded gun away from his 
<br>mother. She had been threatening suicide while all seven kids stood by terrified. Jose saw this as a 
<br>typical scenario growing up in his home.

<br>chaos. Jose&#x27;s life script required chaos, because without it, he would be out of a job.

<br>guided their lives. Each, in various ways, internalized a belief that they were not OK just as they were 
<br>and their survival depended on becoming something different. To help us connect the dots and see how 
<br>three very different childhood experiences could create three men with very similar life paradigms, it 
<br>might be helpful to do a quick review of the child development principles presented earlier in this 
<br>chapter.

<br>their desired location â a smooth, happy life. </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Even though this life script is often highly ineffective, 
<br>Nice Guys frequently just keep trying harder, doing more of the same, hoping for different results.

<br>internalized toxic shame are usually manifested in one of two ways. In one form, a Nice Guy

He can give concrete examples 
<br>of bad behavior in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood that support his core belief about himself. He 
<br>can tell of breaking windows and getting whippings as a little boy. He will reveal running afoul of the 
<br>law and making his mother cry when he was a teenager. He will tell tales of smoking, drinking, using 
<br>drugs and carousing as an adult. He is convinced his only hope for having any kind of happiness in life 
<br>lies in trying his best to mask his inherent badness. He never really believes anyone will buy into his 
<br>Nice Guy persona, but doesn&#x27;t think he has any other choice.

<br>he was never a moment&#x27;s problem. As a teen he did everything right. As an adult, he follows all the rules

<br>from their sons in droves. According to the US census, in 1910 one-third of all families lived on farms. 
<br>By 1940, this number had shrunk to one in five. By 1970, 96 percent of all families lived in urban areas.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:27968px; width:589px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In an agrarian society, boys connected with their fathers by working alongside them in the fields. This 
<br>often meant contact with extended family that included grandfathers, uncles, and cousins. This daily 
<br>contact with men provided boys with an intimate model of maleness. Sons learned about being male by 
<br>watching their dads, just as their own fathers had learned by watching their fathers. As families migrated 
<br>from rural areas to cities and suburbs after World War II, the contact between fathers and sons 
<br>diminished significantly. Dads left home in the morning and went to work. Most sons never got to see 
<br>what their fathers did, let alone have much time to spend with them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:28104px; width:588px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Fathers became unavailable in other ways. Men&#x27;s addictions to work, TV, alcohol, and sex took them 
<br>away from their sons. Increases in divorce began to separate boys from their fathers. Census statistics 
<br>show that the incidence of divorce among men tripled from 1940 to 1970. In 1940, just over five million 
<br>households were headed by women. By 1970, this figure had almost tripled to over 13 million 
<br>households.

<br>relationship with their fathers in childhood.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Sometimes this was a result of their fathers working long 
<br>hours, being withdrawn, or being passive. More often than not, Nice Guys describe their fathers in 
<br>negative terms. They often see them as controlling, rageful, angry, absent, abusive, unavailable, 
<br>addictive, or philandering. </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">It is not unusual at some point in childhood for Nice Guys to have made 
<br>a conscious decision to be different from their fathers.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:28327px; width:577px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The unavailability of dads during this era often required mothers to take over the job of the fathers. 
<br>Women inherited the defacto job of turning boys into men. Unfortunately even the most well-meaning 
<br>mothers are not equipped to teach their sons how to be men by themselves. This hasn&#x27;t kept them from 
<br>trying.

<br>result of mothers, not fathers, teaching their sons how to be male.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Consequently, many Nice Guys 
<br>have adopted a female perspective of masculinity and are comfortable having their manhood 
<br>defined by women.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">

<br>Since World War II, boys have entered schools dominated by females. For most boys, the first several 
<br>years in school become basic training in how to please women. From kindergarten through sixth grade, I

In the primary grades, they make up only 15% of 
<br>the teaching staff, and that number is steadily dropping. From daycare to preschool to elementary 
<br>school, little boys in the post-war era have been surrounded by women. There have been few adult males 
<br>to help them through this experience. If a little boy was already disconnected from his father and trained 
<br>to please a woman, the typical school system magnified this conditioning.

<br>their fathers. Battle lines were drawn between young men protesting a war started and perpetuated by 
<br>their fathers. A generation of World War II veterans could not understand the flaunting of responsibility 
<br>and the social rebellion of their sons. The young men of this generation became the antithesis of their 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">fathers and of an establishment that solved domestic and international problems with guns and bombs.

<br>control provided new freedom, and women&#x27;s liberation was in its infancy. Some mothers during the 
<br>Baby Boom era could foresee a change in gender roles on the horizon. They worked to prepare their 
<br>sons and daughters for what was to come. Many of these mothers raised their daughters to not need a 
<br>man. At the same time, they trained their sons to be different from their fathers â peaceful, giving, 
<br>nurturing, and attentive to a woman&#x27;s needs.

Some feminists 
<br>claimed that men were the cause all of the problems in the world. Others asserted that men were merely 
<br>an unnecessary nuisance. More than likely, the majority of women during this era did not feel this way 
<br>about men. Nevertheless, enough angry women were significantly vocal to contribute to a social climate 
<br>that convinced many men that it was not OK to be just who they were.

Less angry 
<br>slogans of feminism asserted that &quot;a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle.&quot; Men who were 
<br>already conditioned to look to women for definition and approval were especially susceptible to these 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:13px">kinds of messages. This added incentive for these men to try to figure out what women wanted and try to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">become that in order to be loved and get their needs met.

<br>of these men are not happy. You quickly notice the lack of energy in them. They are life-preserving but

<br>with the Baby-Boom generation. I am seeing more and more young men in their twenties, and even 
<br>teens, who demonstrate all of the characteristics of the Nice Guy Syndrome. Not only have these young 
<br>men been effected by all of the social dynamics listed above, even more grew up in single parent 
<br>families or were raised by Nice Guy fathers. As I write this, I expect that we are just beginning on our 
<br>third generation of Nice Guys.

<br>just won&#x27;t take them where they want to go. This is frustrating. But rather than trying something 
<br>different, their life paradigm requires that they keep trying harder, doing more of the same.

<br>Being a Nice Guy is the ultimate attachment for these men. They genuinely believe their commitment to

From the 
<br>moment he begins to dress her he is unconsciously attaching his value and identity to the 
<br>acknowledgment he thinks he will receive from being a &quot;good dad.&quot; He knows that when he takes his 
<br>daughter walking people will look at her and smile. Some will comment about the cute little girl and her 
<br>father out for a walk. A few will stop and ask her age and others will gush about what a precious little 
<br>angel she is. This attention makes Cal feel good about himself.

Further, his dependency on external 
<br>validation actually prevents people from getting to know him just as he is. None of these things have 
<br>anything to do with who he is as a person. Nevertheless, they are the things he believes give him identity 
<br>and value.

<br>most pronounced in their relationships with women. Nice Guys interpret a woman&#x27;s approval as the 
<br>ultimate validation of their worth. Signs of a woman&#x27;s approval can take the form of her desire to have 
<br>sex, flirtatious behavior, a smile, a touch, or attentiveness. At the other end of the spectrum, if a woman 
<br>is depressed, in a bad mood, or angry, Nice Guys interpret these things to mean that she is not accepting 
<br>or approving of them.

<br>woman&#x27;s sexual availability. Since Nice Guys see sex as the ultimate form of acceptance, and they 
<br>believe a woman must be in a good mood before she will have sex, these men are constantly diligent to 
<br>not do anything that might upset a woman whom they desire. In addition, if a woman they desire is

<br>Even if the Nice Guy argues with the woman&#x27;s evaluation, at some level he knows that since she is the 
<br>woman, she must be right. (One Nice Guy asked me, &quot;If a man is talking in the forest and no woman is 
<br>there to hear him, is he still wrong?&quot;)

<br>women, the truth is, most of these men have tremendous rage toward women. This is because we tend to 
<br>eventually despise whatever we make into our god. When our god fails to respond in the ways we 
<br>expect, we humans tend to respond in one of two ways. We either blindly intensify our acts of worship 
<br>or lash out in righteous anger. When Nice Guys put a woman or women on a pedestal and attempt to win 
<br>their approval, sooner or later, this adoration will turn to rage when these objects of worship fail to live 
<br>up to the Nice Guys&#x27; expectations. This is why it is not unusual to hear a Nice Guy proclaim his undying 
<br>love to a woman in one breath and then ragefully call her a &quot;f . . . c . . .&quot; only moments later.

<br>approval. As long as the gay Nice Guy can convince himself that he is not sexually attracted to women, 
<br>he can delude himself into thinking that women don&#x27;t have any power over him.

One way to begin this process is 
<br>to pay attention when trying to impress or get approval. Recovering Nice Guys can observe themselves 
<br>spending extra time on their hair, holding the door open for someone, cleaning the kitchen, or walking 
<br>with their child in the park â just to get noticed or praised.

<br>begin living an </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">inside-out kind of life</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. This means, rather than focusing outward for acceptance and 
<br>approval, they turn inward. In doing so, they can begin asking themselves the important questions: 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-BoldItalic; font-size:14px">&quot;What do I want,&quot; &quot;What feels right to me,&quot; &quot;What would make me happy?&quot;

<br>outside of themselves to get value. During a session of individual therapy, I asked Cal to make a list of 
<br>things he used to get approval from others. The next week he brought in a two-page list. I encouraged 
<br>him to pick one attachment from the list and for the next month, pay attention to how he used it to get 
<br>value.

Cal kept his car perfectly clean, inside and out. He believed this was one 
<br>of the things that impressed people and made them like him. He made a conscious decision to not wash 
<br>or vacuum his car for the next month. While doing so, he would pay attention to how he felt and how 
<br>people responded to him.

<br>that people were looking at his filthy car and judging him. When he drove to work or a friend&#x27;s house, he

Surprisingly enough, 
<br>during the month, not one person had commented on his dirty car and no one had quit liking him or 
<br>removed their love from him. Likewise, washing and waxing his car after a month didn&#x27;t make anyone 
<br>like him better or garner him any new friends.

<br>This will conflict with his deeply held belief that he is worthless. As a result, he will experience

<br>recovering Nice Guys to keep being good to themselves, no matter how frightening. In time the core 
<br>messages from childhood are replaced with new, more accurate beliefs that reflect their inherent worth.

<br>he occasionally heard a little voice that said he wasn&#x27;t worth it, doing so was one of the most affirming

<br>When alone, Nice Guys can discover who they are, what they like about themselves, and what rules they 
<br>choose to govern their lives. I strongly recommend that Nice Guys take trips and retreats by themselves 
<br>to places where no one knows them. In this context, the Nice Guy has fewer reasons to try to win 
<br>people&#x27;s approval, and there is less of a need to try to hide faults and mistakes. While alone, Nice Guys 
<br>can reflect on themselves and their life direction. It is also a good time to practice taking responsibility 
<br>for one&#x27;s needs.

He 
<br>will go to bed and get up when he wants. He will decide when and what to eat. He will decide where he 
<br>goes and what he does. When alone he will be less likely to caretake, seek approval, sacrifice self, or try 
<br>to fix someone&#x27;s problems.

<br>loneliness and isolation. When the Nice Guy discovers that spending time alone doesn&#x27;t kill him, he may 
<br>also realize that he doesn&#x27;t have to stay in bad relationships, tolerate intolerable behavior, or manipulate 
<br>people to try to get his needs met.

<br>with addictive patterns such as keeping busy, or using sex, food, or alcohol to medicate. Writing in a 
<br>journal during these times can be especially effective. Some of the most insightful periods I have 
<br>experienced in life have been by myself on weekend camping trips, week-long retreats, and times when 
<br>my wife has been out of town.

<br>and unlovable. Changing this core belief requires that they bring their humanity out into the open, 
<br>release their toxic shame, and receive more accurate messages than the ones internalized in childhood. 
<br>By necessity, this process requires a safe person or safe people.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:42271px; width:568px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As frightening as it may initially feel, finding these safe people is essential for learning to approve of 
<br>self. The recovering Nice Guy cannot do this part alone. Safe people are essential for reversing the 
<br>distorted beliefs all Nice Guys have about their worth.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:42340px; width:588px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">This process requires building trust. I suggest that the recovering Nice Guy set a regular time to meet 
<br>with his safe person or group, and a little at a time, start revealing himself. This process begins by just 
<br>talking about himself. This in itself makes many Nice Guys uncomfortable. Over time, the recovering 
<br>Nice Guy can begin revealing the things about himself that he is the least comfortable letting others see. 
<br>Once trust has been established, he can begin to reveal things about himself that create fear and shame. I 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">have watched many Nice Guys go from being secretive and evasive to revealing their deepest, darkest 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">secrets in the presence of safe people.

<br>process.

<br>minutes. Reid&#x27;s pattern in the group was to either join in actively or stay withdrawn. His quiet periods 
<br>were often a signal that he was emotionally distraught. When an opportune time arose, I told Reid that 
<br>he seemed withdrawn and I asked how he was doing.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:42616px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Once the attention of the group focused on him, his appearance shifted from detachment to terror. &quot;I 
<br>almost didn&#x27;t come tonight.&quot; He whispered softly as he looked down at his hands. &quot;In fact, I was thinking 
<br>about quitting the group.&quot;

<br>against him. One of the group members asked if he was having an affair.

I was so depressed 
<br>that I went out and bought a fifth of Vodka and got drunk. I&#x27;ve been on a binge ever since and I just can&#x27;t 
<br>make myself stop.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:43124px; width:585px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Tears were running down Reid&#x27;s face as the shame of his addiction to alcohol raised its ugly head once 
<br>again. He had been clean and sober since joining the group six months earlier. He was active in AA, but 
<br>had experienced a number of slips and relapses in his 12 years of recovery. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:43193px; width:566px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">A group member handed him a box of tissues and Reid wiped his eyes. He then continued telling his 
<br>story and revealing his shame in between sobs.

He shook his head and shared 
<br>that he had slipped so many times that he didn&#x27;t think anyone would care or want him back.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:43334px; width:577px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Various members of the group shared with Reid that they didn&#x27;t think he was bad nor did they have 
<br>judgment of him. They could see that he was hurting. They told him that they had great respect that he 
<br>came into group and revealed what was going on, especially since he had so much shame about it.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:43404px; width:584px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">After a few moments, Reid revealed, &quot;That&#x27;s not all. There&#x27;s more.&quot; He began to sob once again. Lifting 
<br>his hand to his forehead he shook his head as in disgust for himself.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:43456px; width:581px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;It gets worse. I went to the peep shows near my work two times this week.&quot; He turned his eyes to the 
<br>floor and wept almost uncontrollably. &quot;I had been doing so good.&quot; he choked out between sobs, &quot;Now 
<br>I&#x27;ve blown it all. I feel totally worthless and don&#x27;t want to go on living. I&#x27;ve made a mess of everything.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:43526px; width:577px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">For the rest of the hour, the group supported Reid and encouraged him to go all the way through his 
<br>shame. They reassured him that he wasn&#x27;t bad and that no one had judgment of him. To the contrary, 
<br>everyone respected him for revealing his shame and pain. They supported him in talking to his wife, 
<br>calling his sponsor and going to a meeting. They asked him to call one group member each day during 
<br>the next week and let them know how he was doing.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:43629px; width:587px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">When Reid left the group that night, he was obviously shaken and scared. He had also released a heavy 
<br>burden and received the support of a group of people who genuinely cared about him and wanted him to 
<br>be OK. No matter how deeply Reid feared that his badness would cause people to judge him and 
<br>abandon him, neither of these things happened. Instead, he received the message that there was nothing 
<br>he could do that would make the men in the group stop liking him or stop caring about him.

<br>reality that they are human. Like every other human, Nice Guys make mistakes, use poor judgment, and 
<br>act inappropriately. Nevertheless, their humanity doesn&#x27;t make them bad or unlovable nor does it cause 
<br>other people to stop loving them.

<br>individuals who have some substance and sense of self. Chameleons usually don&#x27;t draw much of a crowd 
<br>or get many ovations.

<br>experience the intimacy and connection they have always desired. By learning to approve of themselves, 
<br>they begin to radiate a life energy and charisma that draws people to them. As Nice Guys stop seeking 
<br>approval and stop trying to hide their perceived flaws, they open a door to start getting what they really 
<br>want in love and life.

<br>experiencing migraine headaches on a regular basis. Even though everything in his life seemed to be 
<br>&quot;fine&quot; â good job, nice home, family, etc. â he never seemed to be happy.

Nice Guys generally focus their attention 
<br>on meeting everyone else&#x27;s needs while trying to be &quot;low maintenance&quot; kinds of guys themselves. When 
<br>I talk with them about making their needs a priority, their response is similar to that of Lars.

When a child&#x27;s needs 
<br>are not met in a timely, healthy manner, the child may come to believe he is &quot;bad&quot; for having needs. He 
<br>may also think that it is his needs that cause people to hurt him or abandon him. Typically Nice Guys 
<br>respond to these inaccurate interpretations of their life events by developing a number of survival 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">mechanisms.

<br>abandoned, they believed it was their needs that drove people away.

<br>bad when the needs weren&#x27;t met. Not only did they learn early not to expect to get their needs met, but 
<br>also that their very survival seemed to depend on appearing not to have needs.

<br>alive, and they could not meet their needs on their own. The only logical solution was to try to appear to 
<br>be needless and wantless while trying to get needs met in indirect and covert ways.

<br>getting their needs met contradicts their childhood paradigms, Nice Guys are extremely uncomfortable 
<br>when they actually do get what they want. Though most Nice Guys have a difficult time grasping this 
<br>concept, they are terrified of getting what they really want and will go to extreme measures to make sure 
<br>they don&#x27;t. Nice Guys carry out this unconscious agenda by connecting with needy or unavailable 
<br>people, operating from an unspoken agenda, being unclear and indirect, pushing people away, and 
<br>sabotaging.

<br>Many of the Nice Guys I&#x27;ve worked with have expressed a heightened interest in sex, yet they frequently 
<br>feel frustrated in their attempts to get these needs met. This is usually because their actions pretty much 
<br>guarantee that they won&#x27;t get what they believe they want.

<br>negative experiences with sex, tend to have a difficult time being sexually expressive. When these 
<br>partners do make themselves available to be sexual, it is not uncommon for Nice Guys to do something 
<br>that further ensures that they don&#x27;t get their needs met. The Nice Guy may respond by taking control 
<br>rather than letting the sexual experience unfold. He may focus on his partner&#x27;s sexual needs before she 
<br>has a chance to pay attention to him. He might start a fight by making a comment about her weight or 
<br>her past unavailability. All of these strategies pretty much ensure that the Nice Guy won&#x27;t have to 
<br>experience the fear, shame, or anxiety that might get triggered if he actually allowed someone to focus 
<br>on his needs.

These 
<br>unconscious, unspoken agreements are the primary way that Nice Guys interact with the world around

<br>contract in which a person </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">gives to get</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Giving &quot;I love yous&quot; to get &quot;I love you toos&quot; in return is the 
<br>basic way Nice Guys go about trying to get all of their needs met. There is nothing wrong with asking 
<br>your partner to tell you she loves you, but telling her &quot;I love you&quot; first to get an &quot;I love you too&quot; in return 
<br>is indirect, unclear, and manipulative.

<br>caretaking. Nice Guys believe their caretaking is fundamentally loving and is one of the things that 
<br>makes them good people. In reality, caretaking has nothing to do with being loving or good. Caretaking 
<br>is an immature and indirect attempt to try to get one&#x27;s needs met.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">caretake in their intimate relationships. Reese, who is gay, lamented in one of his therapy sessions, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;Why can&#x27;t I find a partner who gives as much back to me as I give to him?&quot; He went on to describe how 
<br>all of his boyfriends seemed to be takers and that he always did all of the giving.

Each began wonderfully and 
<br>seemed like the partnership he had been looking for. Each failed because of the same scenario: Reese 
<br>picked men who needed rescuing or fixing.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:49298px; width:586px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The first boyfriend lived in Canada and had recently gotten off drugs. He came to live with Reese but 
<br>never applied for a work visa and struggled to stay clean. Reese went out of his way to be supportive of 
<br>his boyfriend with the hope that he would find a job and stay off drugs. Finally, Reese sent him home to 
<br>get his life straightened out. Later, he found out from a mutual friend that the reason his boyfriend had 
<br>never applied for a work visa was because he was HIV positive, something he failed to tell Reese.

<br>homosexuality. His parents and religion kept him in constant conflict. He was never able to commit to 
<br>the relationship. Nevertheless, Reese went out of his way to be supportive and giving, all with the hopes 
<br>that his boyfriend would eventually get things straightened out and become available to Reese.

He was living on base, some 40 miles from Reese&#x27;s apartment 
<br>and had no car. Reese had to take the initiative in getting together and would often shuttle his partner 
<br>around. Because Reese made more money, he always paid when they went out. Reese frequently bought 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:13px">his boyfriend gifts and loaned him money. When this boyfriend got transferred to a different state, Reese 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">quit his job, sold his car, and moved along with him, only to return in three months because his partner 
<br>started running around on him.

<br>boyfriends, he gave up his job and alienated most of his friends and family. Reese&#x27;s caretaking allowed

<br>encourage their partner to take a day off, buy a new outfit, go to the doctor, take a trip, quit a job, go 
<br>back to school â yet would not give themselves permission to do any of the same things.

<br>feels frustrated and resentful. Remember, the Nice Guy is the one keeping score and he isn&#x27;t totally 
<br>objective.

<br>passive-aggressive behavior, pouting, tantrums, withdrawing, shaming, criticizing, blaming, even 
<br>physical abuse. Once the cycle has been completed, it usually just begins all over again.

<br>tantrum. Sometimes the victim puke will take a more passive-aggressive form in which the Nice Guy 
<br>will have an affair or act out in some hidden way. All the while the person doing the puking will feel 
<br>justified because of the many ways he has been victimized. These victim pukes are one of the primary 
<br>reasons Nice Guys aren&#x27;t always so nice.

<br>puking. Shane had Racquel on a pedestal and deep inside, he believed she could only love him if he was 
<br>&quot;good enough.&quot; In order to win her love he gave her gifts, sent her cards, left phone messages, bought 
<br>her clothes, planned special surprises, and helped with her home and children.

She felt like she could never repay 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Shane for everything he did for her. The truth was â she couldn&#x27;t. Shane was trying to buy her love â 
<br>only the contract wasn&#x27;t clear. In time, the only way she could cope with his pleasing and caretaking was 
<br>by pushing him away.

He couldn&#x27;t understand why if he had fulfilled his end of the 
<br>contract, Racquel wouldn&#x27;t keep hers. He didn&#x27;t think he was that hard to please. The more Shane gave to 
<br>Racquel, the more resentful he became. He would accuse her of not loving him. They would have 
<br>tremendous battles in which they would break up, calling each other all kinds of names. Afterwards 
<br>Shane would feel frightened and remorseful and pursue Racquel and try to fix things (all the while 
<br>resenting her for not pursuing him and trying to fix things). He would then start caretaking and pleasing 
<br>again to win her love. The cycle repeated itself over and over again.

<br>It is essential not only for getting needs met, but also for reclaiming personal power, feeling fully alive, 
<br>and experiencing love and intimacy.

<br>those around them benefit too. Gone are the covert contracts, the guessing games, the anger outbursts, 
<br>and passive-aggressive behavior. Gone are the manipulation, the controlling behavior, and the 
<br>resentment. I learned this lesson first-hand a few years back.

I tried to plan some 
<br>time with my wife Elizabeth, but she seemed ambivalent and unwilling to make a commitment to what 
<br>she wanted to do. I felt frustrated and put my plans on hold. Finally, upon the urging of a friend, I 
<br>decided to try putting myself first over the weekend. I made plans and invited my wife to join me if she 
<br>felt inclined. I did several things I wanted, including spending some time with friends. As it turned out, 
<br>Elizabeth decided to join me on a number of occasions. On Monday, she shared with me that she had 
<br>thoroughly enjoyed the weekend and didn&#x27;t want it to end.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:53461px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In a session of one of my No More Mr. Nice Guy! men&#x27;s groups, I challenged each of the group 
<br>members to experiment with putting themselves first for at least a week. Though the challenge created 
<br>tremendous anxiety for all of the men, each decided to accept it. The experiences of three of Lars, Reese, 
<br>and Shane are presented below.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:53425px; width:80px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica-Bold; font-size:14px">A Challenge

<br>going to make his needs a priority for the following week. She was initially resistant to his proclamation 
<br>â which added to his anxiety. To boost his courage, Lars called a couple of men in the group. Their 
<br>encouragement gave him the support he needed to follow through with his commitment.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:53680px; width:591px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Lars decided to keep it simple. His plan for the week involved making time every day to go the gym and 
<br>work out. Before his children were born, Lars had been physically active. The demands of job, home and 
<br>children had put an end to that. Lars decided to alternate his workouts before and after work. When he 
<br>shared his plan with his wife, she applied a little guilt. &quot;That&#x27;s not fair that you get to work out and I 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:13px">don&#x27;t,&quot; she proclaimed. Lars was tempted to back down. He had an impulse to try to find a solution so 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">his wife could work out too. Instead, he reflected her concern and told her he was going to work out 
<br>anyway.

Nevertheless, 
<br>he persevered. After the third day, his wife actually asked him how his workout went. As the week

<br>enjoyed being around other people at the gym who were also taking good care of themselves. 
<br>Surprisingly, after his first week, his wife told him that he had inspired her to start taking better care of 
<br>herself. She told him that she was going to start dropping the kids off at the daycare center at the gym 
<br>and begin an aerobics class for herself.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:54114px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Reese had joined the No More Mr. Nice Guy! group after his break-up with his last boyfriend. At first he 
<br>had been uncomfortable being the only gay man in the group, but the other men accepted him and he 
<br>had begun to work on developing non-sexual relationships with men.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:54183px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Reese&#x27;s habit on weekends was to go to out with his latest boyfriend to gay bars on Friday, Saturday, and 
<br>Sunday nights. By Monday morning, he was exhausted. He would spend the rest of the week playing 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">catch up. Reese was afraid that if he didn&#x27;t go out whenever his boyfriend wanted, his boyfriend would 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">leave him.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:54270px; width:589px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Reese decided that for one weekend, he would put himself first and do what felt right to him. He told his 
<br>boyfriend in advance. Reese decided that he would go out just one night, not drink, and be in by 
<br>midnight. On Saturday, he made some plans to go to a movie with a couple of guys in the group. On 
<br>Sunday he stayed at home to relax and get caught up on some house cleaning and laundry. His goal was 
<br>to be in bed by 10:00 p.m. on Sunday evening.

His boyfriend hadn&#x27;t dropped him, and 
<br>the rest of the week felt productive and enjoyable.

Shane regularly gave 
<br>her gifts, planned surprises, and did whatever he could to help her out.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:54524px; width:583px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Shane&#x27;s plan for putting himself first involved paying attention to when he had an impulse to do 
<br>something for his girlfriend. Whenever he felt this impulse, he would instead do something for himself. 
<br>When he thought about washing her car, he washed his own instead. When he felt the urge to buy her a 
<br>gift, he bought himself something instead. When he thought about calling her just to see if she was OK, 
<br>he called a group member instead. All of this created tremendous anxiety for Shane.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:54627px; width:585px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Much to his surprise, at the end of the week Racquel reported she felt a lot less smothered by Shane and 
<br>actually looked forward to spending time with him. She even called late one evening after the kids were 
<br>in bed and invited him over to make love. 
<br></span></div><span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:54780px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>

<br>They decided to continue the process. For a period of six months they agreed that Shane would not give 
<br>any gifts or plan any surprises for Racquel. During the following six months he refrained from giving 
<br>her birthday, Christmas, and Valentine&#x27;s cards or gifts. During this time he focused on taking better care 
<br>of himself and getting his needs met.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:54912px; width:591px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In time Shane came to see that not only did Racquel not stop loving him, she actually became more 
<br>giving to Shane. One year latter, they both reported that Shane could give a gift without using it as a way 
<br>to get approval or affirmation. During this time, Shane had also learned that making his needs a priority 
<br>made him less dependent, needy, and fearful. Both Shane and Racquel reported enjoying all the changes 
<br>they had experienced since Shane made the decision to start putting himself first.

<br>they will be loved and get their needs met. There is only one way to change this illogical, nonproductive

Actually doing it is relatively easy. When the 
<br>Nice Guy puts himself first there is only one voice to consider â his own. Decisions are now made by 
<br>one individual, rather than by a committee. He no longer has to mind read, predict, or try to please 
<br>multiple voices with conflicting agendas. When putting himself first all the information he needs to 
<br>make a decision is within him: &quot;Is this what I want? Yes. Then that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do.&quot;

<br>something I had done. Like many of our arguments, Elizabeth felt helpless to get me to see my denial. 
<br>At the same time, I felt unjustly persecuted. Finally, when the argument reached an emotional crescendo, 
<br>Elizabeth shouted in frustration,

This may not sound like a nice thing to say, but it&#x27;s true. Nice Guys tend to be 
<br>wimpy victims because their life paradigm and childhood survival mechanisms require them to sacrifice 
<br>their personal power.

<br>met in a timely, healthy fashion in childhood. These little boys were helpless to prevent people from 
<br>abandoning them, neglecting them, abusing them, using them, or smothering them. They </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">were</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> victims to 
<br>the people who failed to love them, pay attention to them, meet their needs, and protect them.

These 
<br>men tend to see others as causing the problems they are experiencing in life. As a consequence, they 
<br>often feel frustrated, helpless, resentful, and rageful. You can see it in their body language. You can hear 
<br>it in their voices.

<br>life can be smooth, they believe it </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">should</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> be. This belief is the direct result of their childhood 
<br>abandonment experiences. The unpredictability of not having their needs met in a timely, judicious 
<br>fashion was not only frightening, it was potentially life-threatening.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:58568px; width:590px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">In attempt to cope with the uncertainty of their chaotic childhood, Nice Guys developed a belief 
<br>system that if they could just do everything right, then everything would go right in their lives.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> 
<br>Sometimes these men also developed belief systems that their childhood was ideal and problem-free (the 
<br>opposite of reality) in order to cope with their abandonment experiences. These were all distorted 
<br>beliefs, but these illusions helped these helpless little boys deal with the turmoil that was out of their 
<br>control.

<br>opposite of what works. By approaching adult situations with survival mechanisms that were formed 
<br>when they were naive and powerless, they are insured of having very little success in creating anything 
<br>that resembles stability in their lives.

<br>their fearful childhood experiences and perpetuates a vicious cycle. The more frightened they are, the 
<br>more they use their childhood survival mechanisms. The more they use these ineffective mechanisms, 
<br>the less successful they are at negotiating the complexities, challenges and ambiguities of life. The less 
<br>successful they are, the more fearful they become . . . you get the picture.

Gil had reached a crisis point in his relationship with his

<br>that she was depressed, angry all the time, and had no interest in sex. He reported that he constantly 
<br>walked on eggshells, trying to make sure he never did anything to upset her.

They had 
<br>discussed marriage, but both felt apprehension due to the unsettled nature of their relationship. After a 
<br>couple months of couples counseling, Gil began to entertain the idea that all the problems in the 
<br>relationship might not be about Barb. He began looking at his own caretaking and controlling behavior. 
<br>He also became aware that he had few outside interests and no male friends. After a couple more 
<br>months, he joined a No More Mr. Nice Guy! men&#x27;s group.

<br>making Barb better. It was a slow process, but Gil began to see that he could not do anything to change 
<br>Barb and that he was going to have to focus on himself. As he began to let go and detach from Barb he 
<br>felt tremendous anxiety. He had a deep fear that he was going to &quot;get in trouble.&quot; He also believed that 
<br>Barb couldn&#x27;t handle her problems without his help.

<br>wife, Les revealed how Sarah had gained 60 pounds since they married, refused to cook, was depressed, 
<br>no longer wanted to have sex with him, treated him with contempt, and would rage at him without

<br>his wife and his relationship with her. This was a slow and difficult process. Les needed to see Sarah in a

<br>something frightening or difficult.

<br>change allowed him to start asking for what he wanted, set boundaries, and express his feelings of 
<br>resentment and anger. It soon became apparent that Sarah had no desire to look at her role in the 
<br>relationship or make any kind of changes. Though it was painful and frightening, accepting things as 
<br>they really were allowed Les to make the decision to move out and file for divorce.

<br>available to help him create the kind of relationship he wanted.

Any kind of intensity 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">causes Nice Guys to feel out of control. As children, feeling things intensely invited either negative 
<br>attention or no attention at all. Therefore, it came to feel safer to clamp a lid down tightly on any 
<br>emotion that might attract too much negative attention or might cause them to feel abandoned.

<br>share what I was feeling. Like most Nice Guys, I had come to see feelings as a dangerous thing. After 30 
<br>plus years of conditioning, I had no clue what Elizabeth wanted from me. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:62454px; width:590px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Even as I began to become aware of my feelings, I often kept them to myself. It is almost comical how 
<br>infrequently it crosses a Nice Guy&#x27;s mind to tell his partner what he is feeling. On one occasion 
<br>Elizabeth confronted me when I shared a feeling with her that I had been harboring for some time. &quot;Why 
<br>didn&#x27;t you tell me about that when you first felt it?&quot; she questioned. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:62540px; width:569px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;I&#x27;m doing better,&quot; I replied in typical Nice Guy fashion. &quot;It only took me two weeks to get around to 
<br>telling you.&quot;

<br>hurt anyone. The truth is they are covering their own butts. What they are really saying is that they don&#x27;t 
<br>want to do anything that might recreate their childhood experiences. They&#x27;re really not trying to protect 
<br>anyone from harm, they&#x27;re just trying to keep their world smooth and under control.

<br>a Nice Guy is feeling anxious, helpless, shameful, lonely, rageful, or sad, his feelings aren&#x27;t life-
<br>threatening. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:62748px; width:583px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The goal of teaching Nice Guys to embrace their feelings is not to make them soft and &quot;touchy-feely.&quot; 
<br>Men who are in touch with their feelings are powerful, assertive, and energized. Contrary to what many 
<br>Nice Guys believe, they don&#x27;t have to become more like women in order to have their feelings. This is 
<br>why I support men in learning about their feelings from other men.

<br>teach, model, and support this slow, but important process. In a sense, a therapy group can become like a 
<br>family. In this environment, recovering Nice Guys can ask for the kind of help in dealing with feelings 
<br>that was never available to them as children. Since feelings are often messy, a group environment can 
<br>represent a supportive place to momentarily feel out of control. Here, recovering Nice Guys find out 
<br>they won&#x27;t fall overboard and drown if they rock the boat. They also learn that they won&#x27;t shrivel up and 
<br>die if someone else around them has a feeling.

By learning the language of feelings, recovering Nice 
<br>Guys can begin to let go of a lifetime of unnecessary baggage. As they do, they experience a newfound 
<br>energy, optimism, intimacy, and zest for life.

Elizabeth came to me one day 
<br>and revealed that she had backed into a parked car. She felt like a bad little child and waited for me to 
<br>scold her. Even before I had a chance to respond, she began to put up a wall and withdraw as a way of 
<br>protecting herself.

<br>my feelings clearly and directly. Without shaming or attacking I said &quot;Stop.&quot; With an intensity of 
<br>emotion that surprised both of us, I let her know that I wasn&#x27;t pushing her away and I wasn&#x27;t going to 
<br>accept her pushing me away. I told her that I did have feelings about the car, but I had even stronger 
<br>feelings about how she was acting. I said, &quot;Just let me have my feelings about the car, and then we&#x27;ll 
<br>work it out.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:63359px; width:587px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Later, Elizabeth revealed to me (and several of her friends) how much safer she felt when I had my 
<br>feelings. She was able to hear that I was upset about the car but that I didn&#x27;t think she was bad and I 
<br>wasn&#x27;t going to abandon her. The fact that I had such intensity about not letting her push me away 
<br>actually made her feel secure and loved. As a result, she felt safe to stay connected to me and hear my 
<br>feelings about the car. The whole incident brought us closer and has since provided a reference point for 
<br>the healing power of expressing emotions in powerful and direct ways.

<br>not having their needs met in a timely, judicious manner. It was fostered by fearful systems that

<br>Nolan constantly weighed all the issues. What if he left his wife and later realized that it was a mistake? 
<br>What if he messed up his kids&#x27; lives? What if his children never wanted to talk to him again? What if his 
<br>friends thought he was bad? What if God sent him to hell? As long as Nolan stayed &quot;confused&quot; about 
<br>what he should do, he remained paralyzed.

<br>He didn&#x27;t like seeing himself as being fearful. As we explored the memory fear from his childhood, he 
<br>came to realize that any mistakes he made as a child seemed to have everlasting consequences. He 
<br>believed the same would be true in his present situation.

<br>fear, he unconsciously creates a belief that he can handle whatever it is he is afraid of. This challenges 
<br>his memory fear. Challenging this memory fear makes the things outside of him seem less threatening. 
<br>As these things seem less frightening, he feels more confident in confronting them. The more this

This may seem evident to most people, but it is important 
<br>to define &quot;lying,&quot; and &quot;telling the truth,&quot; because Nice Guys are adept at creating definitions that justify 
<br>their behavior. It is not unusual to hear them make statements like &quot;I&#x27;m pretty honest&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m honest 
<br>most of the time&quot; without the slightest awareness of their contradiction of terms. In almost a childlike

<br>want others to know, what they least want to reveal. These are the things they are most likely to hold 
<br>back â and the things they most need to tell. Sometimes they have to practice telling a certain truth 
<br>several times until all of these pieces of information get told.

<br>with anger. Telling the truth is not a magic formula for having a smooth life. But living a life of integrity 
<br>is actually easier than living one built around deceit and distortion.

<br>on trying to guess what everyone else would think is right. Following this committee approach is the 
<br>quickest path to confusion, fear, powerlessness, and dishonesty.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:66135px; width:591px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">When applying the definition above, there are two ways to be </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">out</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> of integrity, but only one way to be </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">in</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> 
<br>it. When a Nice Guy never even bothers to ask himself, &quot;What do I think is right?&quot; or uses the committee 
<br>method, he will always be out of integrity. If he asks himself what he believes is right but doesn&#x27;t do it, 
<br>he is also out of integrity. Only by asking himself what he believes is right and then doing it does he 
<br>become a man of integrity.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:66630px; width:575px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Boundaries are essential for survival. Learning to set boundaries allows Nice Guys to stop feeling like 
<br>helpless victims and reclaim their personal power. Boundary setting is one of the most fundamental 
<br>skills I teach to recovering Nice Guys.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:66700px; width:589px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I demonstrate the concept of boundaries by laying a shoestring on the ground. I tell the Nice Guy that I 
<br>am going to cross his boundary and push him backwards. I instruct him to stop me when he begins to 
<br>feel uncomfortable. It is not unusual for a Nice Guy to stand well back from the line, allowing me to 
<br>violate his space several steps before he even begins to respond. Once I start pushing, it&#x27;s not uncommon 
<br>for a Nice Guy to let me push him back several steps before he does anything to stop me. Sometimes a 
<br>Nice Guy will let me push him all the way to the wall.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:66820px; width:585px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I use this exercise as a graphic demonstration of the need for boundaries in all areas of life. Nice Guys 
<br>are usually more comfortable back-pedaling, giving in, and keeping the peace. They believe if they take 
<br>one more step backward, the other person will quit pushing, and then everything will be smooth.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:66889px; width:590px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">It is not unusual for recovering Nice Guys to go a little overboard when they first learn about boundary 
<br>setting. They have a tendency to swing from one extreme to another. They become Kamikaze boundary 
<br>setters. They try to set boundaries with a sledge hammer or machete. They usually learn in time that they 
<br>only have to use as much resistance as necessary to get the job done.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:66975px; width:572px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In time, they also learn that boundary setting isn&#x27;t about getting other people to be different, but about 
<br>getting themselves to be different. If someone is crossing their boundary, it isn&#x27;t the other person&#x27;s 
<br>problem, it is theirs.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:67045px; width:591px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Because of memory fear, Nice Guys often unconsciously reinforce the very behaviors they find 
<br>intolerable. </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Due to their childhood conditioning, they teach the people around them that they will 
<br>accept having their boundaries violated.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> As recovering Nice Guys begin to take responsibility for how 
<br>they let people treat them, their own behavior begins to change. As they stop reinforcing things they 
<br>aren&#x27;t willing to tolerate, the people around them are given the opportunity to behave differently. This 
<br>gives relationships a chance to survive and grow.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:67164px; width:581px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Jake, an enlisted man in his mid-twenties, is a good example of how tolerating intolerable behavior can 
<br>kill a relationship, and how setting boundaries can give a relationship a chance to survive.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:67217px; width:589px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Just prior to his marriage to his wife Kisha, Kisha had an affair with an old boyfriend. Because Jake 
<br>didn&#x27;t want to lose her, he forgave her and promised to never bring up her infidelity. This established a 
<br>pattern of Kisha pretty much doing whatever she wanted while Jake withheld his feelings and walked on 
<br>eggshells. He would always measure his words in order to avoid saying anything &quot;wrong&quot; that might 
<br>upset her.

<br>too much to drink she would become belligerent and promiscuous. On this occasion she made several 
<br>demeaning remarks to Jake and spent most of the evening slow dancing with other men in the bar.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:67506px; width:584px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">After holding his tongue as long as he could, Jake finally told Kisha that she was drunk and that it was 
<br>time to go home. She swore at him and kept on doing what she was doing. Jake retaliated by calling her 
<br>a &quot;bitch&quot; and drove home. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:67575px; width:587px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">One of her friends brought Kisha home the next morning. For the rest of the day she gave Jake the silent 
<br>treatment. He tried to hold out, but after a few hours of misery, he apologized for calling her a bitch.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:67628px; width:589px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Later that week, he somewhat reluctantly talked about the episode in his No More Mr. Nice Guy! group. 
<br>The group members lovingly confronted him. They pointed out how his willingness to tolerate his wife&#x27;s 
<br>intolerable behavior gave her a license to act in any way she pleased. They told Jake that the problem 
<br>was not Kisha, it was him. Until Jake changed, his wife would have no incentive to change. By not 
<br>setting boundaries he was robbing his marriage of the opportunity to become what it could be.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:67731px; width:580px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The next day, Jake confronted his wife. He acknowledged his role in their situation. He told her that he 
<br>was no longer going to tolerate intolerable behavior. He told her his boundaries. He would no longer 
<br>tolerate Kisha dancing or flirting with other men. He would not tolerate her demeaning him in front of 
<br>their friends. He told her that if she wanted to stay married to him, she had to go to treatment for her 
<br>drinking problem.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:67834px; width:583px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Kisha responded by telling Jake that no one was going to tell her what to do. She packed a bag and 
<br>moved out that night to a friend&#x27;s house. Even though Jake was miserable the next few days, he resisted 
<br>the temptation to call her and beg her to come back. Instead, he called some guys in the group.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:67903px; width:589px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Three nights later, Kisha called and said she wanted to talk. She came over and told Jake that even 
<br>though she initially wanted to tell him to go to hell, she knew he was right. For the first time in their 
<br>marriage, she said she felt respect for him. She said she wanted to save their marriage and was willing to 
<br>do whatever it took to make it work. The following week Kisha entered treatment.

<br>history in which it was not always a good thing to be male. This was primarily the result of two 
<br>significant family and social changes in the post war era: 1) boys were disconnected from their fathers 
<br>and other healthy male role models, and 2) boys were forced to seek approval from women and accept a 
<br>female definition of what it meant to be male.

<br>any negative male traits (like those of their fathers or other &quot;bad&quot; men) and become what they believed 
<br>women wanted them to be. For many men, this life strategy seemed essential if they wanted to be loved, 
<br>get their needs met, and have a smooth life.

<br>experienced in childhood. Because these men did not have a positive bond with their father, they never 
<br>learned the basic skills necessary to build meaningful relationships with men.

<br>distorted thinking usually began in childhood when they tried to be different from their &quot;bad&quot; or 
<br>unavailable father. In adulthood, Nice Guys often create a similar dynamic with men in general. Nice 
<br>Guys may convince themselves they are different from (better than) other men because they believe:

<br>approval of women. This seems logical considering the anti-male climate that has permeated our culture 
<br>since the 1960s. Ironically, these same men frequently complain that women seemed to be attracted to 
<br>&quot;jerks&quot; rather than Nice Guys like them. Many women have shared with me that due to the absence of 
<br>any discernible life energy in Nice Guys, there is little to be attracted to. They also reveal that their 
<br>tendency to be attracted to &quot;jerks&quot; is because these men have more of a masculine edge to them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:71803px; width:588px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As Nice Guys try to avoid the dark side of their masculinity, they also repress many other aspects of this 
<br>male energy force. As a result, they often lose their sexual assertiveness, competitiveness, creativity, 
<br>ego, thirst for experience, boisterousness, exhibitionism, and power. Go watch little boys on the 
<br>playground and you will see these qualities. I am convinced that these are good things worth keeping.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">leadership in their families. Out of fear of upsetting their partner or appearing too much like their 
<br>controlling, authoritarian, or abusive fathers, Nice Guys frequently fail to be the leader their family 
<br>needs. Consequently, the job of leading the family often falls on their wives. Most of the women I talk to 
<br>don&#x27;t want this job, but end up taking it by default.

<br>unconscious bond is the result of a normal childhood developmental phenomenon gone amuck. Let me 
<br>explain.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:72108px; width:587px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">All little boys naturally fall in love with their mother and desire to have her all to themselves. Healthy 
<br>mothers and fathers help their sons successfully move through this normal developmental stage. As they 
<br>do, the young boy individuates from his mother, bonds with men, and becomes available for an intimate 
<br>relationship with another woman in adulthood.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:72194px; width:581px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Each parent plays a significant role in facilitating this healthy transition. First, the mother must know 
<br>how to give enough to meet the child&#x27;s needs without creating dependency. She must also know how to 
<br>get her own needs met so she is not tempted to use her son to fill the void. Second, the father must be 
<br>present and have a healthy bond with his son. This connection helps the little boy move from the cozy 
<br>lap of his mother to the challenging world of men.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:72297px; width:579px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As stated above, most Nice Guys do not report having had close a relationship with their father in 
<br>childhood. As a result, many Nice Guys were forced into an unhealthy bond with their mother. This 
<br>bond might have formed if they had to please an angry, critical, or controlling mother. More often than 
<br>not, the bond was the result of being forced to take care of a needy, dependent, or smothering mother.

<br>on a regular basis. He even takes a yearly road trip with friends across the country for a weekend of golf. 
<br>He looks at these trips with the guys as one of the highlights of his year.

<br>marriage. Alan had made his wife his emotional center. His life revolved around trying to please her and 
<br>make her happy. Due to his ineffective covert contracts, Alan never believed Marie gave as much to him 
<br>as he gave to her. As a result, he was often resentful and passive-aggressive. When Alan began to get his 
<br>emotional and social needs met with men, it took a lot of pressure off his wife.

Even though it 
<br>was initially difficult to tell her that he was going to spend time with his friends, she respected him when 
<br>he did. This newfound respect rekindled the feelings she first felt toward Alan early in their relationship.

Perhaps one of the 
<br>most significant benefits for Nice Guys is that it improves their relationships with women. I consistently 
<br>tell Nice Guys, &quot;The best thing you can do for your relationship with your girlfriend or wife is to have 
<br>male friends.&quot; As they get many of their emotional needs met with men, recovering Nice Guys become 
<br>less dependent, needy, manipulative and resentful in their relationships with women.

<br>approval or allowing themselves to be defined by the opposite sex. If the Nice Guy&#x27;s girlfriend or wife is 
<br>angry at him or thinks he is a jerk, he can take comfort in knowing his buddies think he is OK. He is 
<br>therefore less likely to resort to peacekeeping or fixing to try and keep his partner happy.

<br>agenda. A Nice Guy will frequently avoid doing anything that might upset his partner and cause her to 
<br>not want to have sex with him. With men, recovering Nice Guys don&#x27;t feel like they have to please, 
<br>placate, lie, caretake or sacrifice like they believe they have to with women. Not having a sexual agenda 
<br>removes the fear and dysfunctional dances so common for Nice Guys in their relationships with the 
<br>opposite sex.

Little boys 
<br>get pulled into unhealthy relationships with their mothers only when their fathers allow it. The solution 
<br>to reversing this dynamic is creating healthy relationships with men.

<br>his mother. The boy&#x27;s father frequently traveled for his job, was emotionally unavailable, rigid, and 
<br>demanding. The boy&#x27;s mother smothered her son and made him her emotional partner.

<br>Jamie to be jealous of and in competition with her boyfriend&#x27;s mother. Nevertheless, she passed the

<br>her hook an emotional hose up to him. Jamie could tell that this was primarily the result of her boyfriend 
<br>having bonded with several guys in boot camp and from embracing his own masculinity.

Because of their conditioning, Nice Guys tend to fear these 
<br>traits. As a result, they often become emotionally and physically soft. Some even take pride in this 
<br>softness. I&#x27;ve met many Nice Guys who work out or practice martial arts, but who are still afraid of their 
<br>strength.

In order to do this, 
<br>recovering Nice Guys have to stop putting junk into their bodies and train them to respond to the 
<br>physical demands of being male. This involves eating healthy foods, eliminating drugs and alcohol, 
<br>working out, drinking lots of water, playing, relaxing, and getting enough rest. Whether the Nice Guy 
<br>stays fit by running, swimming, weight training, martial arts, playing basketball, volleyball, or tennis, 
<br>this physical strength translates into self-confidence and power in every other aspect of his life.

<br>if he got a drug and alcohol assessment, quit drinking, and started attending Alcoholics Anonymous. 
<br>Travis complied with all my boundaries and asked if he could join one of the No More Mr. Nice Guy!

In 
<br>addition to marital problems, it also became apparent that Travis had a number of other lifestyle 
<br>problems. His diet consisted primarily of fast food. He was a chain smoker and he drank several cups of 
<br>coffee a day. He worked long hours and got absolutely no exercise.

He started taking time 
<br>away from work to attend AA meetings and spend time with other recovering men. He decided to have a 
<br>surgery he had been putting off for years. Since he wouldn&#x27;t be able to smoke for a few days, he decided 
<br>it was a good time to quit for good. After his surgery, he began going for walks during his lunch hour. 
<br>He started drinking more water and cut back on his coffee and soft drink consumption. He even took a 
<br>week off from work and went fishing with some friends in Alaska.

<br>revealed that his wife blamed the group for killing their marriage. Travis smiled and then wiped a tear 
<br>from the corner of his eye. &quot;Thanks to this group, I feel strong. I never could have made these changes 
<br>without your help. This group didn&#x27;t kill my marriage, it saved my life.&quot;

<br>that Nice Guys hold them accountable by expressing their feelings to them â including rage and anger. 
<br>This is essential, even if these men are dead. Sometimes this takes place in their fathers&#x27; presence,

<br>summer before my son Steve entered the fourth grade. When I attended his PTA open house I was jolted 
<br>with a dose of reality. In kindergarten through fifth grade, there was only one male classroom teacher in 
<br>the whole school. That&#x27;s about a 20-to-1 ratio. As the teachers were introduced a grade at a time and then 
<br>stood together on the gym floor, I received a visual picture of the environment in which little boys spend 
<br>the most impressionable years of their lives.

<br>sons and daughter, but to a whole generation of boys and girls. The more time I spend working with 
<br>Nice Guys, the more I realize that this process represents a powerful tool for giving the next generation a 
<br>saner model of what it means to be men and women.

<br>nursery ruled by women (home, preschool, school) and enter the world of adult manhood. Robert Bly 
<br>discusses the importance of these rituals in his book </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">Iron John.

<br>adolescence. When it is time for the boys to leave the sphere of female influence and move into the 
<br>men&#x27;s world, the men of the tribe stage a raid. They put on their war paint, enter the village, and steal the 
<br>boys away. The women, on cue, weep, protest, and do their best to hang onto the boys. After the men 
<br>have taken the boys outside the village for their period of initiation, the women get together and ask, 
<br>&quot;How did I do? Was I believable?&quot; In these cultures, the men and women work together to facilitate this 
<br>process of transition and initiation.

<br>own. I have a theory that the phase that adolescent boys pass through where they dress sloppily, look 
<br>scraggly, act aggressively, hole up in their room, slouch, play loud music, swear, and spit a lot, are all 
<br>unconsciously aimed at making themselves so repulsive that even their mothers can&#x27;t stand them. This 
<br>helps them break the symbiotic bonds with their moms. Nevertheless, these young men still need help 
<br>from adult males in pulling away from their mothers without feeling guilt and shame and without overly 
<br>self-destructive behaviors.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:79826px; width:580px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I believe recovering Nice Guys can help boys find a saner model of what it means to be male in our 
<br>culture. This is because there are certain things that boys can only learn from men. As Nice Guys 
<br>embrace their masculinity, they can teach their sons what it means to be male. This includes how to 
<br>handle their aggression, how to handle their libido, how to relate to women, how to bond with a man, 
<br>and perhaps most importantly, how to embrace their own masculinity. Men teach these lessons both by 
<br>example and by interaction with young boys.

<br>I&#x27;m around my boys, I get to see unbridled maleness in action. Not only do I get to teach my sons how to 
<br>handle their testosterone-related behaviors such as aggression and sexuality, they also show me how to 
<br>embrace mine.

Fathers need to take their sons hunting and fishing, 
<br>work on cars with them, take them to work, coach their teams, take them to ball games, work out with 
<br>them, take them on business trips, and let them tag along with them when they go out with the guys. All 
<br>of these activities help boys move successfully into the male world.

<br>relatives, scouts, sports teams, school activities, or big brothers.

One night in his men&#x27;s

<br>strong feelings about what was happening to his nephew because the boy was going through some of the 
<br>same rebellion and acting out with alcohol that Trey had experienced at the same age. The group 
<br>encouraged Trey to reach out to his nephew and be a positive male influence.

<br>do, she is depressed, angry, unavailable, or unfaithful (or all of the above).

I define </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">intimacy</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> as &quot;knowing the self, being known by another, and 
<br>knowing another.&quot; Intimacy requires two people who are willing to courageously look inward and make 
<br>themselves totally visible to another. Internalized toxic shame makes this kind of exposure feel life-
<br>threatening for Nice Guys.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:83980px; width:590px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Intimacy, by its nature, would require the Nice Guy to look into the abyss of his most inner self and 
<br>allow others to peer into these same places. It would require the Nice Guy to let someone get close 
<br>enough to see into all the nooks and crannies of his soul. This terrifies Nice Guys, because being known 
<br>means being found out. All Nice Guys have worked their entire lives to become what they believe others 
<br>want them to be while trying to hide their perceived flaws. The demands of intimacy represent 
<br>everything Nice Guys fear most.

<br>Nice Guys enter a relationship they begin a balancing act. In relationships, a life-and-death struggle is 
<br>played out to balance their fear of vulnerability with their fear of isolation. Vulnerability means someone 
<br>may get too close to them and see how bad they are. Nice Guys are convinced that when others make 
<br>this discovery, these people will hurt them, shame them, or leave them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:84380px; width:564px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The alternative doesn&#x27;t seem any better. Isolating themselves from others recreates the abandonment 
<br>experiences that were so terrifying in childhood.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:84432px; width:587px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In order to balance his fear of vulnerability and fear of abandonment, a Nice Guy needs help. He finds it 
<br>in people who are equally wounded and also have difficulty with intimacy. Together they co-create 
<br>relationships that simultaneously frustrate all parties while protecting them from their fear of being 
<br>found out. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:84518px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Even though it may look like many of the problems Nice Guys experience in relationships are caused by 
<br>the baggage their partner brings with them, this is not the case. It is the relationship the Nice Guy and his 
<br>partner co-create that is the problem.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:84588px; width:585px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">It is true that Nice Guys often pick partners who appear to be projects, and indeed, they do at times pick 
<br>some pretty messed up people. The fact that these partners may have challenges â they are single 
<br>moms, they have financial problems, they are angry, addictive, depressed, overweight, non-sexual, or 
<br>unable to be faithful â is precisely the reason Nice Guys invite these people into their lives. As long as 
<br>attention is focused on the flaws of the partner, it is diverted away from the internalized toxic shame of 
<br>the Nice Guy. This balancing act ensures that the Nice Guy&#x27;s closest relationship will most likely be his 
<br>least intimate.

The first is through 
<br>becoming overly involved in an intimate relationship at the expense of one&#x27;s self and other outside 
<br>interests. The second is through being emotionally unavailable to a primary partner while playing the 
<br>Nice Guy role outside of the relationship. I call the first type of Nice Guy an </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">enmesher</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> and the second 
<br>type an </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">avoider</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:84891px; width:585px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The enmeshing Nice Guy makes his partner his emotional center. His world revolves around her. She is 
<br>more important than his work, his buddies, his hobbies. He will do whatever it takes to make her happy. 
<br>He will give her gifts, try to fix her problems, and arrange his schedule to be with her. He will gladly 
<br>sacrifice his wants and needs to win her love. He will even tolerate her bad moods, rage attacks, 
<br>addictions, and emotional or sexual unavailability â all because he &quot;loves her so much.&quot;

They are like little dogs who hover beneath 
<br>the table just in case a scrap happens to fall their way. Enmeshing Nice Guys do this same hovering 
<br>routine around their partner just in case she happens to drop him a scrap of sexual interest, a scrap of her 
<br>time, a scrap of a good mood, or a scrap of her attention. Even though they are settling for the leftovers 
<br>that fall from the table, enmeshing Nice Guys think they are getting something really good.

<br>relationship, but this is an illusion. The Nice Guy&#x27;s pursuing and enmeshing behavior is an attempt to 
<br>hook up an emotional hose to his partner. This hose is used to suck the life out of her and fill an empty 
<br>place inside of him. The Nice Guy&#x27;s partner unconsciously picks up on this agenda and works like hell to 
<br>make sure the Nice Guy can&#x27;t get close enough to hook up the hose. Consequently, the Nice Guy&#x27;s 
<br>partner is often seen as the one preventing the closeness the Nice Guy desires.

<br>hobby, parents, and everything else before his primary relationship.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> He may not seem like a Nice 
<br>Guy to his partner at all because he is often nice to everyone else but her. He may volunteer to work on 
<br>other people&#x27;s cars. He may spend weekends fixing his mother&#x27;s roof. He may work two or three jobs. 
<br>He may coach his children&#x27;s sports teams. Even though he may not follow his partner around and cater to 
<br>her every whim, he still operates from a covert contract that since he is a Nice Guy, his partner should be 
<br>available to him, even if he isn&#x27;t available to her.

They may help 
<br>the Nice Guy feel safe, but they won&#x27;t help him feel loved.

<br>often help her become what he needs. He may project upon her one or more traits of his parents. He may 
<br>act as if she is a certain way, even when she isn&#x27;t. His unconscious dysfunctional needs may literally 
<br>force his partner to respond in an equally dysfunctional way.

<br>house. More often than not, it wasn&#x27;t good. I learned to come home prepared for the worst. I later 
<br>recreated the same pattern in my marriage. I projected my father&#x27;s unpredictable moods onto my wife 
<br>and would frequently arrive home prepared for her to be angry. Even if she was in a good mood, my 
<br>defensiveness often triggered some kind of confrontation between us. Thus Elizabeth came to look like

<br>make bad relationships work. Basically, Nice Guys suffer from the age-old problem of looking for love 
<br>in all the wrong places. If a Nice Guy spends all of his time stuck in a bad relationship, it pretty much 
<br>guarantees he won&#x27;t find one that might work better.

<br>partner they have chosen lacks the basic qualities they desire, they move on. Not Nice Guys. Due to their 
<br>conditioning, Nice Guys just keep trying harder to get a non-workable situation to work or get someone 
<br>to be something they are not. This tendency frustrates everybody involved.

They frequently do it too 
<br>late and in indirect, blaming, or deceitful ways. They typically have to do it several times before it 
<br>sticks. I often joke that, on average, it takes Nice Guys about nine attempts to end a relationship.

<br>one desires. I frequently encourage recovering Nice Guys to be </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">just who they are, without reservation</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. I 
<br>support them in deciding what is right for them and being that with all of their energy for the whole 
<br>world to see. The people who like them just as they are will hang around. The people who don&#x27;t, won&#x27;t. 
<br>This is the only way to have a healthy relationship. No one really wants to believe that they have to be 
<br>false or hide who they really are to get someone to love them or stay with them. Yet, this is a common 
<br>dynamic in the intimate relationships Nice Guys create. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:88659px; width:589px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">George is a good example of what can happen when a recovering Nice Guy decides to start pleasing 
<br>himself and stop pleasing his partner. Throughout his relationship with his wife Susan, George&#x27;s primary 
<br>goal was to make her happy. Over a period of five years George gave up hunting and fishing (two of his 
<br>passions), quit hanging out with his friends, turned the control of his finances over to Susan, and 
<br>supported her in quitting her job because she was unhappy at work. These changes occurred gradually. 
<br>All were an attempt on George&#x27;s part to please Susan. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:88779px; width:577px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Nevertheless, Susan was rarely happy. By the time George joined a No More Mr. Nice Guy! group, he 
<br>felt helpless and resentful and was ready to leave his wife. George saw Susan as the cause of the 
<br>frustration he was feeling. George spent the first few weeks in our group complaining about his wife. 
<br>Eventually, the group members began to confront George on his victim role and challenged him to do 
<br>something different instead of blaming Susan.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:88882px; width:584px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">It took a few more months, but George began to change. The most significant change was a conscious 
<br>decision to quit trying to make Susan happy. He realized that his attempts to please her weren&#x27;t working 
<br>and were causing him to feel resentful.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:88951px; width:583px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">George began by setting aside one weekend a month to go hunting or fishing. When Susan tried several 
<br>different methods to manipulate him or guilt him out of his decision, he held fast. Next, instead of 
<br>handing his paycheck over to Susan to control, he began giving himself an allowance to spend how he 
<br>wanted. This too drew resistance from his wife. Perhaps the most frightening step was when George set 
<br>up a budget and told Susan that if she wanted more control over the income, she would have to go back 
<br>to working full time.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:89071px; width:575px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Ironically, two things began to happen. George felt less like a victim and actually started having more 
<br>positive feelings toward Susan. Second, Susan began taking charge of her own life and became less 
<br>dependent on George. After about a year in group, George shared how much more content he was and 
<br>how much his marriage had improved. He gave credit to the group members who supported him in 
<br>finding the courage to start pleasing himself and stop trying to make Susan happy.

Nowhere is the issue of boundary setting more 
<br>important for Nice Guys than in their most intimate relationships. By setting healthy boundaries with 
<br>their partners, Nice Guys create situations in which both they and their partner can feel safe to be 
<br>vulnerable and experience true intimacy. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:89594px; width:589px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I show Nice Guys, often with their partners watching, how to step up to their line and set boundaries. On 
<br>more than one occasion, I have had the partner of a Nice Guy applaud during the demonstration. The 
<br>Nice Guy will turn, slack-jawed, and say, &quot;You mean you want me to stand up to you, dear?&quot;

She doesn&#x27;t feel safe knowing she can push you 
<br>around. She wants to know that you will stand up to her. That is how she will feel secure in the 
<br>relationship. But, here&#x27;s the catch. She has to test to see if she can trust you. The first time you set a 
<br>boundary with her she may react intensely. She will push against it. She will tell you that you are wrong 
<br>for setting that boundary. She will do her best to find out if your boundary is for real.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:89802px; width:589px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">When a recovering Nice Guy sets boundaries with his partner, it makes her feel secure. In general, when 
<br>women feel secure, they feel loved. She will also come to know that if her partner will stand up to her, 
<br>he is also likely to stand up for her. Setting boundaries also creates respect. When a Nice Guy fails to set 
<br>boundaries it communicates to his partner that he doesn&#x27;t really honor himself, so why should she?
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:89888px; width:579px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">To help Nice Guys decide if they need to set a boundary with a particular behavior, I have them apply 
<br>the </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Second Date Rule.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Using the second date rule, Nice Guys ask themselves, &quot;If this behavior had 
<br>occurred on the second date, would there have been a third?&quot; This question helps them see if they have 
<br>been putting up with something that they shouldn&#x27;t.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:89975px; width:587px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">When trying to decide how to deal with a behavior they have deemed unacceptable, I encourage Nice 
<br>Guys to apply the </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Healthy Male Rule.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Following this rule of thumb, they simply ask themselves, &quot;How 
<br>would a healthy male handle this situation?&quot; For some reason, just asking this question connects them 
<br>with their intuitive wisdom and helps them access the power they need to respond appropriately.

<br>him, get close, have feelings, be sexual, and so on. He can let these things happen because he is 
<br>confident that at any point, if he begins to feel uncomfortable, he can say &quot;stop,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; or &quot;slow down,&quot; 
<br>or can remove himself. He can do whatever he needs to do to take care of himself.

When Nice Guys enter a relationship, they frequently 
<br>choose partners who look more dysfunctional than they do. This creates a dangerous illusion that one of 
<br>them is sicker than the other. This is a distortion, because healthy people are not attracted to unhealthy 
<br>people â and vice versa. I frequently tell couples that if you have one obviously wounded person in a 
<br>relationship, you always have two. No exception.

<br>broken one while I was designated the healthy one. These scripts worked well for both of us until she 
<br>started going to counseling. One day, she came home from a therapy session and announced that she had 
<br>discovered that I was just as messed up as she was. Because I couldn&#x27;t entertain the idea that I was 
<br>&quot;messed up,&quot; I responded, &quot;No, you are really finding out that you are just as healthy as I am.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:91123px; width:575px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The relationship system we had created together allowed both of us to play familiar, yet dysfunctional 
<br>roles. Unfortunately, it also prevented any kind of real intimacy until Elizabeth began to challenge the 
<br>status quo. I&#x27;ve listened to countless Nice Guys who have formed relationships like the one Elizabeth 
<br>and I initially created. These men have the belief that they are victims to their &quot;sick&quot; partner&#x27;s 
<br>dysfunction. This illusion keeps everyone involved stuck in repetitive, ineffective patterns.

<br>partner to get in touch with their childhood experiences of abandonment, neglect, abuse, and smothering. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">They can use this information to better understand why they have created the kind of relationship system 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">they have. This process enables them to make changes that allow them to get what they want in their 
<br>intimate relationships.

<br>significant other as a partner in healing. This not only shifts how he views his partner, but also allows 
<br>him to address childhood issues that prevent him from having a truly intimate relationship.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:91577px; width:589px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In the beginning of this chapter, we met Karl â whose wife Danita seemed as hard to please as his cold, 
<br>critical mother. Karl never knew when his mom might get angry, criticize, or shame him. In adulthood, 
<br>Karl co-created a similar dynamic with Danita. When she got angry, Karl would use all of his childhood 
<br>survival mechanisms, like avoidance and withdrawal, to try to cope. Karl would accuse Danita of &quot;being 
<br>angry all the time&quot; and would walk on eggshells to avoid upsetting her. Karl would tell himself, &quot;I don&#x27;t 
<br>deserve this.&quot; He would then retreat and create escape scenarios in his head.

<br>help him clean out his old issues around his fear of angry and critical people. As Karl made this shift

<br>standing up to Danita rather than avoiding and withdrawing. As he came to see Danita&#x27;s anger as a result 
<br>of her own childhood wounding, Danita began to look less and less angry to him. As his view of his wife 
<br>began to shift, Karl began to feel more loving toward Danita and their relationship began to show 
<br>marked improvement.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:92287px; width:590px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">A couple of years ago we bought a Weimaraner puppy. We decided that if we were going to have a big 
<br>dog in the house, we should take him to obedience school. One of the first lessons we learned was that 
<br>we were the ones who needed obedience training. Most dogs that behave badly, we found out, have been 
<br>conditioned to do so by ignorant or inconsistent owners.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:92373px; width:570px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In many ways, humans aren&#x27;t much different from pets. People often behave the way they have been 
<br>trained to behave. For example, if a person gives his dog a treat when he pisses on the carpet, the dog 
<br>will keep pissing on the carpet. The same is true for humans. If the Nice Guy reinforces his partner&#x27;s 
<br>undesirable behaviors, she will keep behaving in undesirable ways.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:92459px; width:591px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Here is the irony for Nice Guys: Nice Guys like the idea of a smooth and problem-free relationship. 
<br>Typically, if their partner is unhappy, depressed, angry, or having a problem, they will jump right in and 
<br>try and fix it or make it better. They believe that by doing so, they will make the problem go away and 
<br>everything will quickly get back to normal. Unfortunately, this is like giving a dog a treat for pissing on 
<br>the carpet. Every time a Nice Guy responds to or pays attention to a behavior he would like to eliminate, 
<br>he is actually reinforcing that very behavior. This reinforcement increases the likelihood that that 
<br>behavior will occur again. For example, Joe&#x27;s wife frequently came home from work in a silent rage over

<br>attempt to relieve his anxiety, he would ask his wife what was wrong. After a little coaxing, she would 
<br>spend the next couple of hours venting to Joe about how mistreated she was at work. Joe would listen 
<br>and offer helpful suggestions, hoping that by doing so, she would get over her mood.

Every 
<br>time he asked his wife what was wrong, listened for hours, and offered advice, he was actually 
<br>reinforcing a behavior pattern he found undesirable. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:92852px; width:552px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In dog obedience school we learned that if you want an undesirable behavior to go away, </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">you stop 
<br>paying attention to it.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> The same is true in relationships. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:92905px; width:576px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Like many Nice Guys, Joe felt like a victim to his wife&#x27;s behavior. He was oblivious to the fact that he 
<br>was responsible for perpetuating a behavior he found undesirable. When the men in his No More Mr. 
<br>Nice Guy! group pointed this fact out to him, he decided to try something different.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:92974px; width:588px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The next time his wife came home in a silent, withdrawn mood, he didn&#x27;t say anything. He ate dinner in 
<br>silence and then went out to the garage. Even though he felt intense anxiety, he resisted his impulses to 
<br>try to &quot;fix&quot; his wife. As he lay awake in bed that night, the deafening silence kept him awake for hours. 
<br>The next morning, the silence continued. Joe was afraid this behavior might go on forever. In an attempt 
<br>to relieve his anxiety, he tried making a little small talk. His wife responded with one-word answers and 
<br>left for work.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:93094px; width:589px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">That evening, it seemed as if a miracle had occurred. Joe&#x27;s wife came home from work in a good mood 
<br>and asked Joe if he wanted to go for a walk. While walking she told him how she had resolved the 
<br>previous day&#x27;s problem. Joe revealed to his wife how uncomfortable it had made him to not try to fix her 
<br>problem the previous evening. She responded by telling Joe that she didn&#x27;t want him to try to fix her 
<br>problems and that she liked it better that he had given her some space to work it out on her own.

<br>encourage them to take a different approach when beginning new relationships. Relationships are messy 
<br>and there is no way to eliminate the bumps and potholes, but we don&#x27;t have to make them any more 
<br>difficult than they already are. This is one area where I strongly encourage Nice Guys to </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">do something 
<br>different.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> That is, enter relationships with a healthy agenda, rather than an unconscious, dysfunctional 
<br>one.

<br>challenge when it comes to restoring a car, but it&#x27;s a terrible way to choose a partner. Nice Guys have a

<br>Because they don&#x27;t know why a healthy or independent person would want them, they settle for a 
<br>diamond in the rough. They tend to pick partners who have had troubled childhoods, are sexual abuse 
<br>survivors, have had a string of bad relationships, are depressed, are having money problems, are 
<br>overweight, or are struggling single moms. Then they go to work operating from a covert contract â 
<br>fixing, caretaking, and pleasing â all with the hope that she will turn out to be a polished gem. 
<br>Unfortunately, this strategy rarely works.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:93675px; width:580px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">When recovering Nice Guys create relationships with people who don&#x27;t need fixing, they improve their 
<br>odds of finding the love they want. This doesn&#x27;t mean searching for the </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">perfect</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> partner, just one who is 
<br>already taking responsibility for her own life. Over time, the members of my No More Mr. Nice Guy! 
<br>groups have come up with a number of traits to </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">consciously</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> look for when creating new relationships. 
<br>These traits include (in no particular order):
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:35px; top:93778px; width:200px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: ZapfDingbats; font-size:7px">l</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:7px">     </span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Passion.

<br>well by this list (especially if it is the Nice Guy doing the evaluating). That doesn&#x27;t mean they need to 
<br>jump out of the relationship and go looking for greener pastures. Instead, I encourage these men to first 
<br>begin addressing their own behaviors and look at why they needed to create the kind of relationship they 
<br>have with their present partner.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:94018px; width:575px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Finding a new partner won&#x27;t be the solution if the Nice Guy still needs the same kind of relationship. I 
<br>have found that when recovering Nice Guys begin dealing with their own dysfunctional patterns, their 
<br>relationships also begin changing. At times these changes cause them to reevaluate their desire to get 
<br>out. Sometimes they confirm it is time for a change.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:94104px; width:568px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Nice Guys have a strong tendency to try to do everything &quot;right.&quot; This list isn&#x27;t meant as a magic 
<br>formula. There are no perfect people and no perfect relationships. But by consciously looking for the 
<br>traits listed above in a prospective partner, Nice Guys can save themselves a lot of grief and improve 
<br>their chances of actually finding what they are looking for.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:94190px; width:584px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Doing something different also means refraining from being sexual in new relationships. Nice Guys 
<br>must give themselves a chance to accurately evaluate the traits listed above by staying out of bed with a

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">whom I have ever worked has had some significant problem with sex. These problems are manifested in 
<br>many ways, but the most common are:

<br>the unavailability of women in general).

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Vagiphobia</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> to describe this propensity. Vagiphobia is a syndrome where the penis tries to stay out of 
<br>vaginas or gets out quickly once it is in. While this survival mechanism may help protect the Nice Guy 
<br>from having to experience his shame and fear, it also guarantees he won&#x27;t have very much sex.

<br>none were ever consummated with intercourse. The problem came to a head after he began a

In social situations he always felt more 
<br>comfortable connecting with women. Over time, it became apparent that due to childhood conditioning 
<br>â a monogamous bond with his mother, the decision to be different from his father, and the effects of 
<br>fundamentalist religious teachings â Alan found creative ways to get the attention of women while 
<br>avoiding putting his penis in their vaginas. (I refer to this common Nice Guy behavior as &quot;flirting 
<br>without fucking.&quot; As long as the Nice Guy doesn&#x27;t put his penis in a vagina, he can exchange all kinds of 
<br>sexual energy yet convince himself he hasn&#x27;t really had sex or hasn&#x27;t done anything wrong.)
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:97921px; width:589px; height:131px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">On one occasion, Alan shared an example with his No More Mr. Nice Guy! group of this behavior. Alan 
<br>had been on a business trip, traveling with a co-worker, a young woman whom Alan found very 
<br>attractive. During the trip, they flirted and exchanged sexual innuendoes. One evening, they sat in the 
<br>bar and talked about their lives. The evening ended with some slow dancing. The next evening after 
<br>drinks, the woman invited Alan to join her in the hot tub. She showed up in a revealing string bikini. 
<br>While in the hot tub, she sat on Alan&#x27;s lap and they kissed passionately. Even though he was very 
<br>aroused, he turned down her offer to go up to her room because he didn&#x27;t want to &quot;jeopardize their 
<br>working relationship.&quot;

Alan had a couple of girlfriends in 
<br>high school. But whenever the girls got serious and wanted to move beyond petting, Alan felt smothered 
<br>and broke up.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:98144px; width:587px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Alan portrayed his wife as being sexually withdrawn. One factor that contributed to this situation was 
<br>that Alan would never directly initiate sex. He believed women thought sex was bad and he was 
<br>convinced that if he was too direct in letting them know he wanted to have sex, they would think </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">he</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> was 
<br>bad.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:98230px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Alan used his frustration over his wife&#x27;s sexual unavailability to justify his sexualized behavior with 
<br>other women. Interestingly enough, Alan had a consistent knack of only flirting with women that weren&#x27;t 
<br>very likely to be available to consummate a relationship with him. On the rare occasion that he guessed 
<br>wrong, Alan would find some good reason to not follow through with what he had started.

Being a good lover can be an 
<br>attachment these men use to feel valuable. It can be a way to convince themselves they are different 
<br>from other men. It can also be a very effective mechanism for allowing them to have sex while staying 
<br>distracted from their internalized shame and fear. As long as they are focused on the arousal and 
<br>pleasure of their partner, Nice Guys can distract themselves from their own toxic shame, feelings of 
<br>inadequacy, or fear of being smothered. Terrance, a Nice Guy in his mid-thirties is a good example.

<br>devastating. The good news is, I met a wonderful, sensual, sexual woman, and we&#x27;re engaged to get

<br>Whenever they had sex, Terrance would try to make sure his girlfriend had two or three orgasms by 
<br>stimulating her orally before he put his penis inside her vagina. He then tried to bring her to one more 
<br>climax vaginally. Unfortunately, he frequently ejaculated before she had her final orgasm. Terrance was 
<br>so seemingly selfless that he told his fiancÃ©e that he didn&#x27;t care if he never had an orgasm, as long as she 
<br>was satisfied.

Her parents love me. 
<br>She says she loves everything about me, except she feels like 30 percent is missing. She doesn&#x27;t seem to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">want to make love anymore and is talking about postponing the wedding until I can get this thing fixed.&quot;

<br>to be great lovers. When Nice Guys set out to be great lovers, they are actually creating a recipe for 
<br>boring sex. Sex that focuses on trying to please the other guarantees a routine, do-what-worked-last-time 
<br>kind of experience. Trying to be a great lover pretty much insures that a Nice Guy will not have many 
<br>passionate, reciprocal, spontaneous, serendipitous, or intimate sexual experiences â hardly a recipe for 
<br>good sex!

<br>Want
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:99053px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Imagine the financial jackpot of inventing a pill to take away loneliness, cure boredom, alleviate feelings 
<br>of worthlessness, smooth over conflict, create feelings of being loved, relieve stress, and generally solve 
<br>all personal problems. Nice Guys believe such a drug exists â they call it sex.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:99122px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Many Nice Guys discovered at an early age that sexual arousal was a good distraction from the isolation, 
<br>turmoil, unrealistic demands, and abandonment experiences of their childhood. Unfortunately, when 
<br>Nice Guys bring their sensual security blanket into adulthood, it prevents them from experiencing 
<br>intimate and fulfilling sex with another individual.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:99208px; width:585px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I have found Nice Guys to be prone to hidden, compulsive sexual behavior. I have developed a theory 
<br>that states, </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">the nicer the guy, the darker the sexual secrets.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> I find this to be consistently true. Sex is a 
<br>basic human drive. Because most Nice Guys believe they are bad for being sexual, or believe that other 
<br>people will think they are bad, sexual impulses have to be kept hidden from view. The Nice Guy&#x27;s 
<br>sexuality doesn&#x27;t go away, it just goes underground. Therefore, the more dependent a man is on external 
<br>approval, the deeper he is going to have to hide his sexual behavior.

<br>Everybody liked Lyle. He was one of those guys who didn&#x27;t seem to have any rough edges. A devout 
<br>Christian, Lyle taught Sunday school and was always willing to help anyone in need.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:99510px; width:577px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Lyle&#x27;s life seemed perfect. There was only one hitch â he was secretly addicted to pornography. 
<br>Growing up in an Evangelical Christian home, he first discovered this drug when he was nine. A loner 
<br>as a child, Lyle would spend hours in his tree fort looking at pictures of naked women. With his 
<br>pornography, he never felt alone.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:99596px; width:584px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Fifteen years into his marriage, Lyle&#x27;s habit remained a well-kept secret. Over the years his compulsive 
<br>behavior expanded to renting adult videos, visiting peep shows and strip bars, and calling 900 numbers. 
<br>Most recently, his obsession had found flight in cyberspace. Frequenting sex chat rooms he carried on a 
<br>number of sexual relationships with faceless surfers on the Internet.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:99682px; width:574px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Periodically during their marriage, Lyle&#x27;s wife would confront him over their lackluster sex life. She 
<br>would protest that it just wasn&#x27;t normal to go months without having sex. Lyle would validate her 
<br>feelings and assert that he too would like more sex. He would then fall back on the excuse that he was 
<br>usually too tired from work and too stressed with the demands of family life.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:99768px; width:585px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Many times throughout his life, Lyle promised himself he would quit visiting his secret sexual world. 
<br>Time and time again he would throw out his stash of magazines or swear off the videos and chat rooms. 
<br>He would breathe a sigh of relief, only to find himself back at it again weeks or months later.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:99838px; width:563px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Lyle, like numerous Nice Guys, invested so much time and energy in his hidden, compulsive sexual 
<br>behavior that there was little left for a real, person-to-person sexual relationship.

<br>opposite sex. If he is to have any hope of securing a girlfriend and someday having sex, he must figure 
<br>out what it takes to get a female to notice him and approve of him. For some boys this process seems to 
<br>come fairly easily. If they happen to be good-looking, a star athlete, or from an affluent family, 
<br>attracting females may not be overly difficult for them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100040px; width:591px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Once you exclude the minority of adolescent males listed above, that leaves the majority of teenage boys 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:13px">who have no clue of what it will take to get a girl to like them. It is at this point that many young men 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">decide that maybe by being &quot;nice,&quot; they will stand out from the other guys and might gain the approval 
<br>of some member of the opposite sex. This decision is especially important if the young man has already 
<br>been conditioned to believe that he is not OK just as he is.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100143px; width:583px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">It is this strategy formed in adolescence â trying to attract a woman and her sexual favor by being nice 
<br></span></div><span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:100248px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>

<br>woman would be lucky to have them while simultaneously wondering why any woman would want 
<br>them. Because they can&#x27;t think of any other reason why a woman would be attracted to them or want to 
<br>have sex with them, Nice Guys hang on to their strategy of &quot;being nice&quot; even when it consistently 
<br>proves ineffective in getting them the sex they want.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100378px; width:588px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Ironically, trying to be nice robs a man of his life energy. The more a Nice Guy seeks approval and tries 
<br>to &quot;do it right,&quot; the tighter he clamps a lid down on any kind of energy that might actually draw a person 
<br>to him. This is why I frequently hear Nice Guys lament about women not being attracted to them. The 
<br>problem is, once they have repressed all of their life energy, there is little about them to get anyone&#x27;s 
<br>attention or turn them on.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100481px; width:581px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Women consistently tell me that even though they may be initially drawn to a Nice Guy&#x27;s pleasing 
<br>demeanor, over time they find it difficult to get excited about having sex with him. Often the partner 
<br>feels defective, but it is really not her fault. There is just very little about the Nice Guy persona to flip a 
<br>switch or arouse a prospective partner. Once again, by doing the opposite of what works, Nice Guys 
<br>prevent themselves from getting the sex they want.

<br>When she would say &quot;no&quot; he would pout and withdraw. When she did consent to being sexual he would 
<br>focus on her arousal while she did little to reciprocate. With pithy awareness she revealed, &quot;I could tell 
<br>him it would really turn me on if he set himself on fire. He would gladly do it and think he was getting 
<br>good sex because it made me happy.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100733px; width:588px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">By settling for bad sex, Nice Guys insure that they won&#x27;t get to experience very much good sex. Aaron 
<br>provides a good example of a pretty common way Nice Guys create bad sex. Let&#x27;s visit his bedroom and 
<br>observe a typical sexual scenario between him and his wife Hannah.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100802px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Aaron and Hannah haven&#x27;t had sex in several weeks, a common occurrence in their relationship. 
<br>Tonight, Aaron is feeling sexual, but instead of telling Hannah that he wants to make love, he goes into a 
<br>pattern of indirectly trying to arouse her. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100872px; width:581px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Even though Hannah has let Aaron know on several occasions she resents his &quot;pestering,&quot; he moves up 
<br>behind her in bed and begins to rub her back. As he massages her shoulders he momentarily tunes out 
<br>his resentment over her sexual unavailability. As he slowly moves his hands down to rub her buttocks, 
<br>he also tunes out that her body is totally unreceptive to his touch. He hopes that by moving slowly and 
<br>not alarming her by being too overtly sexual, she will get in the mood. This approach has occasionally 
<br>worked in the past.

<br>his own body. By now, he is focused on Hannah&#x27;s arousal and trying to anticipate how to stimulate her 
<br>just enough to get her in the mood without doing too much to make her angry.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:101186px; width:590px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Finally, because she hasn&#x27;t rebuffed his advances, he rolls her over and for the next twenty minutes 
<br>focuses all of his attention on her arousal until she has an orgasm. Since he is disconnected from his own 
<br>physical arousal, he has a difficult time climaxing himself. To help himself along, he fantasizes about 
<br>the young secretary at work. When he finally has an orgasm, he immediately shifts his focus back to his 
<br>wife to check in on her emotional state. Later, as he rolls over and goes to sleep, Aaron feels empty and 
<br>resentful.

A man can read all the books 
<br>he wants on &quot;How To Pick Up Women&quot; or watch all the instructional videos on improving sexual 
<br>technique. None of these things will help him get good sex as long as he has shame and fear about being 
<br>sexual or being a sexual being. Getting good sex is dependent on recovering Nice Guys bringing their 
<br>shame and fear out of the closet and into the open were they can be looked at and released. </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">This step

<br>sexual shame and fear out of the closet. Lyle was a good Christian, husband, and father who struggled 
<br>with compulsive sexual behavior. Everything came crashing down for Lyle when his wife found a phone 
<br>bill and called some of the strange numbers. She was bewildered and devastated. Never in her wildest 
<br>dreams (or nightmares) did she think that Lyle might be involved in anything like pornography or phone 
<br>sex. Little did she know she had just discovered the tip of the iceberg. Confronted with the evidence, 
<br>Lyle initially feigned surprise and denied any knowledge of its origin. Finally, he broke down and told 
<br>all. Well, almost all. It took several more weeks, several more emotional confrontations, and a call to me 
<br>before everything came out.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:103053px; width:591px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">After a couple of sessions of individual therapy, I suggested that Lyle start attending a 12-step group for 
<br>sexual addicts. This idea initially terrified Lyle, but he knew he would have to do something radically 
<br>different if he wanted to free himself of his compulsion and experience true sexual intimacy. To his 
<br>surprise, revealing his long-kept secrets in the presence of other recovering sex addicts wasn&#x27;t as difficult 
<br>as he feared. In time, he began to look forward to the opportunity to talk about himself with safe people. 
<br>Every time he revealed some secret thought or act, he felt a sense of relief, as if a weight had been lifted 
<br>from his shoulders.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:103190px; width:584px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As Lyle revealed his fear and shame to safe people, he found that he was less interested in his hidden, 
<br>compulsive behaviors. As he and his wife became more open and intimate with each other, he also 
<br>began to enjoy a physical closeness with her that he had once tried to avoid. When Lyle came out of the 
<br>closet, he began to heal a lifetime of hidden sexual behavior.

<br>of the closet. I support them in talking explicitly about their sexuality. In our culture, most sex talk is 
<br>done in pornographic, demeaning, moralizing, shaming, clinical, or joking ways. I invite recovering 
<br>Nice Guys to reveal the ways they act out. I have them talk about their sexual history and early sexual 
<br>experiences. I ask them to bring samples of pornography they find arousing. This is another way of 
<br>releasing shame while also gaining important information.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:103396px; width:585px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Throughout the entire process of revealing themselves, I encourage recovering Nice Guys to experience 
<br>whatever they may be feeling â shame, guilt, fear, arousal. At the same time, I give them supportive 
<br>messages that what they are feeling is OK. There are so many negative messages in our society about 
<br>male sexuality, it is difficult for Nice Guys to overcome their conditioning without this kind of 
<br>encouragement and support.

<br>especially true with sex. When recovering Nice Guys decide to take responsibility for their own needs 
<br>and take matters into their own hands, they put themselves in a position to get the quantity and quality of 
<br>sex they want. Let me explain.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:104060px; width:588px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">All significant behavior patterns are the sum of many, much smaller behavior patterns. The most 
<br>effective way to change a behavior is to change its smallest elements. For example, if a Nice Guys is not 
<br>getting as much sex as he wants or isn&#x27;t getting the kind of sex he wants, the only way to change this 
<br>behavior pattern is to change its smallest components. Rather than going out and trying to have more 
<br>sex, it is more effective to change the little things that create the overall pattern of not getting much sex. 
<br>Change the little things, and the big picture changes as a result.

<br>they must learn how to have the same with themselves. By taking matters into their own hands â by 
<br>practicing </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">healthy masturbation</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> â recovering Nice Guys can change the most basic dynamics that

Healthy 
<br>masturbation is a process of letting sexual energy unfold. It has no goal or destination. It&#x27;s not just about 
<br>orgasms. It does not require outside stimulation from pornography and doesn&#x27;t use trances or fantasy to 
<br>stay distracted from shame and fear. It is about learning to pay attention to what feels good. Most of all, 
<br>it is about accepting sole responsibility for one&#x27;s sexual pleasure and expression.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:104707px; width:583px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Many Nice Guys are initially uncomfortable with the discussion of healthy masturbation. The concept 
<br>seems like an oxymoron. In general, Nice Guys have tremendous internalized shame around 
<br>masturbation. They also frequently surround themselves with people who reinforce this shame (partner, 
<br>religion, etc.). Many Nice Guys also struggle with compulsive masturbation. They fear that attempting 
<br>any kind of self-gratification might open up Pandora&#x27;s Box.

<br>using fantasy or pornography there is no way for their behavior to become compulsive. I have also found 
<br>that when they share the experience with other non-judgmental men, their shame diminishes rapidly.

<br>ex-wife did.

<br>regularly that this would make him more attractive to his fiancÃ©e, not less. As he began to discover that 
<br>making his needs a priority didn&#x27;t drive his girlfriend away, we took it to the next step. I talked with 
<br>Terrance about healthy masturbation. I encouraged him to find a time when he would be undisturbed in 
<br>which he could focus on his own pleasure and arousal. I suggested that he do this without having a goal 
<br>of climaxing and without using fantasy or pornography. I encouraged him to pay attention to what felt 
<br>good to him and to observe the ways he unconsciously tried to distract himself from his shame and fear.

The first time he tried it he reported not 
<br>feeling &quot;much of anything.&quot; I encouraged him to continue the assignment at least once a week. After a 
<br>few weeks he reported that he was actually beginning to enjoy pleasuring himself but felt some shame

We talked 
<br>about Terrance taking his focus off her arousal and orgasms and beginning to focus more on himself. 
<br>His girlfriend actually expressed relief. She revealed that it felt like a burden when Terrance expected 
<br>her to have multiple orgasms. Instead of telling him this in the past, she had just faked it.

They actually 
<br>began spending more time talking with each other about what they liked and didn&#x27;t like while they were 
<br>having sex. Even though it was initially difficult, Terrance shared with his fiancÃ©e what he had found out 
<br>about himself from his own healthy masturbation. He was surprised when she expressed interest in 
<br>pleasuring him and having a reciprocal sexual relationship with him.

It has no goal. It 
<br>is free of agendas and expectations. Rather than being a performance, it is an unfolding of sexual energy. 
<br>It is about two people revealing themselves in the most intimate and vulnerable of ways. Good sex 
<br>occurs when two people focus on their own pleasure, passion, and arousal, and stay connected to those 
<br>same things in their partner. All of these dynamics allow good sex to unfold in unpredictable, 
<br>spontaneous, and memorable ways.

<br>sex. For the first few weeks in the No More Mr. Nice Guy! group, Aaron vented his frustrations and 
<br>shared how helpless he felt to get Hannah to want to have sex with him. It was obvious that Aaron 
<br>believed his wife held the key to his sexual happiness and that he was angry over her willful refusal to 
<br>use that key. As a result, he felt &quot;rejected&quot; and &quot;worthless.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:107477px; width:588px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">After a few weeks, I suggested that Aaron go on a sexual moratorium in which he refrained from having 
<br>sex with Hannah for a period of six months. During this time I suggested that he focus on doing things 
<br>he had given up when he and Hannah got married. I also encouraged him to tell Hannah whatever he 
<br>was feeling. I shared with him that a sexual moratorium would make it easier for him to do these things 
<br>because he wouldn&#x27;t be so concerned about maintaining the possibility of her availability. If they weren&#x27;t 
<br>having sex, he wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about doing something that might make her angry and cause her 
<br>to withhold sex.

<br>I told him the goal was not to get her to have more sex, but for him to reclaim his key and stop feeling 
<br>like a victim.

<br>planned to do.

<br>reported doing things for himself that previously would have created tremendous anxiety. He went out 
<br>with some guy friends he hadn&#x27;t seen in a couple of years. He began to share his feelings with his wife. 
<br>On more than one occasion, this included telling her when he was angry at her. He even let her know on 
<br>a couple of occasions when he wasn&#x27;t in the mood to listen to her talk about her problems. He also found 
<br>that he became more honest â revealing things to her that he had previously kept to himself.

She revealed to him that 
<br>since he was not pursuing her, she felt freer to move toward him. She also expressed that she liked being 
<br>able to have sexual energy with Aaron, without it always having to end up in intercourse.

<br>that he was too tired to listen. Even though she was initially angry, later that night she asked him if he 
<br>wanted to make love.

If they 
<br>don&#x27;t start something, they won&#x27;t fail. If they don&#x27;t finish something, they won&#x27;t be criticized. If they have 
<br>too much going on at once, they won&#x27;t have to do any one thing well. If they have enough good excuses, 
<br>people won&#x27;t expect too much of them.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:113159px; width:590px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Because their needs were not met in a timely, judicious fashion in childhood, Nice Guys developed a 
<br>distorted view of themselves. With a naive, immature logic they came to the conclusion that if their 
<br>needs were not important, neither were they. This is the basis of their toxic shame. At their core, all Nice 
<br>Guys believe they are not important or good enough.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:113245px; width:581px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">If a Nice Guy was called on to take care of a critical, needy, or dependent parent, he received a double 
<br>dose of toxic shame. A child believes he should be able to please a critical parent, fix the problems of a 
<br>depressed parent, and meet the needs of a smothering parent. Unfortunately, he can&#x27;t.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:113315px; width:583px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">As a result of their inability to fix, please, or take care of one or more parents, many Nice Guys 
<br>developed a deep-seated sense of inadequacy.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> They believed they </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">should</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> be able to do the job. 
<br>Nevertheless, they never could seem to do it right or good enough â mom was still depressed, dad was 
<br>still critical.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:113401px; width:581px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">This internalized sense of inadequacy and defectiveness is carried into adulthood. Some Nice Guys 
<br>compensate by trying to do everything right. They hope that by doing so, no one will ever find out how 
<br>inadequate they are. Other Nice Guys just give up before they try.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:113470px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">This feeling of inadequacy prevents Nice Guys from making themselves visible, taking chances, or 
<br>trying something new. It keeps them in the same old rut, never seeing how talented and intelligent they 
<br>really are. Everyone around them can see these things, but their distorted childhood lenses won&#x27;t let them 
<br>accurately see their true potential and ability.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:113557px; width:585px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The result of this distorted self-image is an </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">emotional and cognitive</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">glass ceiling</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. This invisible lid 
<br>prevents Nice Guys from being all they can be. If they do try to rise above it, they bump their heads and 
<br>tumble down to more familiar territory.

<br>enough of what they needed to go around. This deprivation experience became the lenses through which 
<br>they viewed the world. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:113854px; width:580px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">This paradigm of scarcity and deprivation makes Nice Guys manipulative and controlling. It causes 
<br>them to believe they better hang on to what they&#x27;ve got and not take too many chances. It leads them to 
<br>resent other people who seem to have what they lack.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:113923px; width:584px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Because of their deprivation thinking, Nice Guys think small. They don&#x27;t believe they deserve to have 
<br>good things. They find all kinds of ways to make sure their view of the world is never challenged. They 
<br>settle for scraps and think it is all they deserve. They create all kinds of rationalizations to explain why 
<br>they will never have what they really desire. Because of their self-fulfilling beliefs, Nice Guys rarely 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">live up to their potential or get what they really want in life.

<br>love. The first is that they tend to recreate familiar, yet dissatisfying relationships. They find partners 
<br>who will help them create the same dysfunctional kinds of relationships they experienced as children. 
<br>These men then frequently see themselves as being victims to the dysfunction of their partners. Nice 
<br>Guys have a difficult time seeing that they were attracted to these people for a reason.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:114192px; width:572px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Second, Nice Guys rarely experience the kind of relationships they want because they are bad enders. 
<br>When a healthy person would pack up and move on, Nice Guys just keep doing more of the same, 
<br>hoping that something will miraculously change.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:114262px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Nice Guys aren&#x27;t much different in their jobs. They are attracted to careers and work situations that allow 
<br>them to recreate the dysfunctional roles, relationships, and rules of their childhood. They often see 
<br>themselves as helpless victims to these situations. Rarely do they see why they need these systems to be 
<br>the way they are and that they have the choice to leave.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:114348px; width:574px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Unconsciously recreating familiar family patterns in their jobs and careers keeps Nice Guys stuck and 
<br>dissatisfied. While they are perpetuating the dysfunction of their childhood, they rarely do what they 
<br>really want or rise to the top of their chosen vocation.

<br>leave the group a millionaire. This statement really has very little to do with money or material wealth 
<br>â it is about discovering passion and living up to potential.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:114658px; width:581px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As stated above, the Nice Guys I counsel are generally intelligent, talented men. As these men work on 
<br>recovering from the Nice Guy Syndrome, they begin to accept themselves just as they are. This 
<br>acceptance of the self allows them to embrace their passions and face their fears.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:114727px; width:587px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The formation of a more accurate view of the self and the world allows the abundance of the universe to 
<br>begin flowing freely into their lives. Sometimes this takes the form of money. Sometimes it takes the 
<br>form of love. Sometimes it takes the form of sex. Sometimes it takes the form of the bright lights of 
<br>fame. Sometimes it includes all of the above.

When I first met 
<br>Charlie he was stuck in a job he hated and living a life characterized by mediocrity and fear. Charlie had 
<br>completed his engineering degree a couple of years before, yet he was still working at the same job he 
<br>had held before starting college. Charlie&#x27;s employers had promised him a big promotion upon 
<br>graduation. When they failed to keep their promise, Charlie just stifled his resentment and kept on doing 
<br>the same old thing he had always done.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:115049px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Charlie&#x27;s single passion was flying. In spite of warnings of disaster from his mother, he had begun taking 
<br>flying lessons after he finished college. Though Charlie dreamed of earning his pilot&#x27;s license, he never 
<br>seemed to be able to complete the necessary requirements to achieve his goal.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:115119px; width:584px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">A woman at his work introduced Charlie to my website. When he read the description of a Nice Guy he 
<br>was mortified. He couldn&#x27;t figure out how someone could know him so well. It took him six months 
<br>before he worked up the nerve to send me an email. It took him another two months to send me a 
<br>second. From the first time Charlie looked at my website he knew he needed to join a men&#x27;s group, but 
<br>the idea of being that vulnerable terrified him.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:115222px; width:584px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">It was at that point that Charlie made a decision that changed his life. Charlie decided that if something 
<br>frightened him that much, he needed to face his fear and do it. Little did he know then, but that decision 
<br>was just the beginning of a journey that would lead Charlie toward the rediscovery of his passion and 
<br>purpose in life.

<br>that fear. Charlie&#x27;s progress was slow but steady. Basically, he crawled until he could walk. He took 
<br>baby steps until he could run. Once he got going, there was no stopping him.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:115500px; width:571px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Over the period of about eighteen months Charlie took several steps toward rediscovering his passion 
<br>and purpose in life.

<br>Guy! group. Initially, when there was no agenda or goal, my writing was a spontaneous recording of my 
<br>growing insight into the Nice Guy Syndrome. Before long, clients and family members began 
<br>suggesting that I write a book. It seemed like a logical extension of what I was already doing so the idea 
<br>made perfect sense.

Rather than being just a few insights and illustrations 
<br>written for the benefit of a handful of clients, my effort became directed at producing something that 
<br>would be deserving of publication and widespread distribution. I began hearing people suggest things 
<br>like &quot;bestseller,&quot; &quot;Oprah,&quot; and &quot;get rich.&quot;

<br>Numerous factors contributed to the length of time it took to finish the book, but the number one reason 
<br>was that I thought it had to be </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">perfect.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> I thought the book had to be perfect to be published. I thought it

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">write everything I knew about the Nice Guy Syndrome! The original manuscript of this book was 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">probably four times its present length. I believed I had to be an eloquent writer. I believed the text had to 
<br>be flawless.

<br>predicting that I never would finish. My wife half-seriously threatened to leave me if I didn&#x27;t finish.

A very wise person suggested that I give myself 
<br>permission to never publish the book. I felt an immediate sense of relief.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:119224px; width:589px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I realized that I had gotten away from my original goal â to write a few insights that would help a few 
<br>men live better lives. Once I let go of the burden of having to get published, be a best-selling author, and 
<br>appear on Oprah, everything changed. I went back to my original agenda. From then on when I wrote, I 
<br>only asked myself one thing: &quot;Will this help my clients find answers to their problems?&quot; I also kept 
<br>reminding myself that my clients would never get a chance to benefit from my insight if I never finished 
<br>the book.

I 
<br>completed the book. Clients reported that it was changing their lives. Therapists began to request copies 
<br>for their clients. Radio talk show hosts and newspaper and magazine writers began contacting me for 
<br>interviews. I hired an agent. Publishers began pursuing me.

<br>old single-pane windows replaced on his house. Some of the group members began asking questions 
<br>about the cost. Some shared that they had done that kind of project before. I suggested that Phil ask the 
<br>group to help him. It was like pulling teeth, but Phil asked the men if they would help him replace his 
<br>windows. The members of the group responded unanimously that they would be glad to. About a month 
<br>later the men got together at Phil&#x27;s house and had the equivalent of an old fashion barn-raising.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120724px; width:586px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">These two experiences had a tremendous impact on Phil. He began to see that his needs were important, 
<br>that people wanted to help him meet his needs, and that the surest way of getting people to help was to 
<br>ask.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120794px; width:573px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Phil began to build on this new paradigm. Within a few weeks he shared a plan with the group to start 
<br>his own business. A friend of the family had offered to help him get started in his own landscaping 
<br>business. This prospect especially excited him because the seasonal work would allow him to teach 
<br>snowboarding during the winter â a life long dream.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120880px; width:575px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">An old friend offered to be his financial backer. His wife volunteered to look for a job that paid health 
<br>insurance benefits. Men in the group offered to help him write a business plan and set up his 
<br>bookkeeping.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120949px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As long as Phil tried to do everything himself, he struggled to get what he wanted. Once he started 
<br>asking for help and letting people be there for him, his life began to turn around. He is now headed in the 
<br>direction of creating the kind of life and vocation he has always dreamed of.

<br>life. They waste time, they procrastinate, they start things but don&#x27;t finish, they spend too much time 
<br>fixing other people&#x27;s problems, they distract themselves with trivial pursuits, they create chaos, they 
<br>make excuses.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:121630px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Sal is a good example of this. Sal was raised by a passive father and a schizophrenic mother. Neither 
<br>parent was available to pay attention to him or meet his needs. At a young age he had to take 
<br>responsibility for the welfare of his younger brother. Sal had virtually no options as a child. When he felt 
<br>frightened or overwhelmed, he would just hunker down and trudge ahead with dogged determination.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:121716px; width:589px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As an adult, Sal ran a body shop for his uncle. His uncle was a cheap, shortsighted, marginally involved 
<br>business owner. It was Sal&#x27;s job to create a profitable business with the limited resources and dissatisfied 
<br>employees his uncle provided. (Sal actually operated on the assumption that this feat could be 
<br>successfully accomplished!)

<br>quiet the stress headache created by trying to negotiate an impossible situation at work. On one occasion 
<br>I asked Sal if he wanted to explore options for his work situation. &quot;What&#x27;s the use?&quot; he replied. &quot;There&#x27;s 
<br>nothing that can be done.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:121889px; width:583px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">For about fifteen minutes, group members asked questions and proposed options.

There is 
<br>no way it could ever happen though. I&#x27;d have to work evenings and weekends. My wife just wouldn&#x27;t go

His eyes reflected a 
<br>terror as if he was being interrogated by Gestapo agents with cattle prods and ice picks. When it became 
<br>apparent that exploring possible options only aggravated his fear and caused him to shut down further, 
<br>the group members mercifully backed off. Later, Sal referred to the experience as &quot;being reamed by the 
<br>group.&quot;

<br>job. It was much more familiar and comfortable to stay stuck in a stressful, no-win situation.

<br>sabotaging himself. This is a crucial aspect in recovery from the Nice Guy Syndrome. In order to start 
<br>getting what they want in life, work, and career, recovering Nice Guys have to make the conscious 
<br>decision to get out of their own way.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">becoming aware of why they unconsciously create so many barriers that keep them feeling stuck. A 
<br>mortgage, a wife, a lack of a degree, debt, children â are all just excuses. Making significant life 
<br>changes doesn&#x27;t require chucking all these things. It means seeing them for what they really are â 
<br>excuses â and taking small steps in the direction one wants to be going.

<br>into savings and investments. He kept a minimum balance of $30,000 in his checking account. In spite 
<br>of his ability to create financial wealth, Russell was controlled by his deprivation thinking. Russell was

<br>His father was miserly and rigid. He seemed to single Russell out for critical treatment, while heaping 
<br>praise and favor on his two brothers. Later, before he died, his father cut Russell out of his will and gave 
<br>Russell&#x27;s share to the church. It is no wonder that Russell viewed the world through lenses clouded by

<br>making others happy. Nice Guys avoid conflict like the plague and will go to great lengths to avoid 
<br>upsetting anyone. In general, Nice Guys are peaceful and generous. Nice Guys are especially concerned 
<br>about pleasing women and being different from other men. In a nutshell, </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys believe that if they

<br>have believed a myth.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">belief that if Nice Guys are &quot;good,&quot; they will be loved, get their needs met, and live a problem-free life. 
<br>When this life strategy fails to produce the desired results â as it often does â Nice Guys usually just 
<br>try harder, doing more of the same. Due to the sense of helplessness and resentment this pattern 
<br>inevitably produces, Nice Guys are often anything but nice.

<br>never getting back what I believed I deserved. I was the typical &quot;sensitive new age guy&quot; â and proud of 
<br>it. I believed I was one of the nicest guys you would ever meet. Yet I wasn&#x27;t happy.

<br>core belief system about themselves and the world around them. These men have been conditioned to 
<br>believe that if they are &quot;nice,&quot; they will be loved, get their needs met, and have a smooth life.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10286px; width:561px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The term Nice Guy is actually a misnomer because Nice Guys are often anything but nice. Here are 
<br>some Not-So-Nice Traits of Nice Guys:
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10338px; width:565px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are dishonest</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. These men hide their mistakes, avoid conflict, say what they think people 
<br>want to hear, and repress their feelings. These traits make Nice Guys fundamentally dishonest.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10391px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are secretive.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Because they are so driven to seek approval, Nice Guys will hide anything that 
<br>they believe might upset anyone. The Nice Guy motto is, &quot;If at first you don&#x27;t succeed, hide the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">evidence.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10460px; width:583px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are compartmentalized.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Nice Guys are adept at harmonizing contradictory pieces of 
<br>information about themselves by separating them into individual compartments in their minds. 
<br>Therefore, a married man can create his own definition of fidelity which allows him to deny that he had 
<br>an affair with his secretary (or intern) because he never put his penis in her vagina.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10547px; width:590px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are manipulative</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Nice Guys tend to have a hard time making their needs a priority and 
<br>have difficulty asking for what they want in clear and direct ways. This creates a sense of powerlessness. 
<br>Therefore, they frequently resort to manipulation when trying to get their needs met.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10616px; width:582px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are controlling</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. A major priority for Nice Guys is keeping their world smooth. This creates 
<br>a constant need to try to control the people and things around them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10669px; width:550px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> </span><span style="font-family: Times-BoldItalic; font-size:14px">give to get</span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px"> </span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Though Nice Guys tend to be generous givers, their giving often has 
<br>unconscious and unspoken strings attached. They want to be appreciated, they want some kind of 
<br>reciprocation, they want someone to stop being angry at them, etc. Nice Guys often report feeling 
<br>frustrated or resentful as a result of giving so much while seemingly getting so little in return.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10755px; width:574px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are passive-aggressive</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Nice Guys tend to express their frustration and resentment in 
<br>indirect, roundabout, and not so nice ways. This includes being unavailable, forgetting, being late, not 
<br>following through, not being able to get an erection, climaxing too quickly, and repeating the same 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:13px">annoying behaviors even when they have promised to never do them again.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:10841px; width:579px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are full of rage</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Though Nice Guys frequently deny ever getting angry, a lifetime of 
<br>frustration and resentment creates a pressure cooker of repressed rage deep inside these men. This rage 
<br>tends to erupt at some of the most unexpected and seemingly inappropriate times.

Addictive behavior serves the purpose of relieving stress, altering moods, or 
<br>medicating pain. Since Nice Guys tend to keep so much bottled up inside, it has to come out somewhere. 
<br>One of the most common addictive behaviors for Nice Guys is sexual compulsiveness.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:11092px; width:580px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys have difficulty setting boundaries</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Many Nice Guys have a hard time saying &quot;no,&quot; &quot;stop,&quot; 
<br>or &quot;I&#x27;m going to.&quot; They often feel like helpless victims and see the other person as the cause of the 
<br>problems they are experiencing.

Though Nice Guys desire to be liked and loved, their behaviors 
<br>actually make it difficult for people to get very close to them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:11214px; width:570px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are often attracted to people and situations that need fixing.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> This behavior is often the 
<br>result of the Nice Guy&#x27;s childhood conditioning, his need to look good, or his quest for approval. 
<br>Unfortunately, this tendency pretty much guarantees that Nice Guys will spend most of their time 
<br>putting out fires and managing crises.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:11300px; width:568px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys frequently have problems in intimate relationships.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Though Nice Guys often put 
<br>tremendous emphasis on this part of their lives, their intimate relationships are frequently a source of 
<br>struggle and frustration. For example:

<br>Guys tend to blame their partner for standing in the way of their happiness.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:11506px; width:584px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys have issues with sexuality</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Though most Nice Guys deny having problems with sex, I have 
<br>yet to meet one who isn&#x27;t either dissatisfied with his sex life, has a sexual dysfunction (can&#x27;t get or 
<br>maintain an erection, climaxes too quickly), or has sexually acted out (through affairs, prostitution, 
<br>pornography, compulsive masturbation, etc.).
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:11592px; width:585px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Nice Guys are usually only relatively successful</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. The majority of Nice Guys I&#x27;ve met have been 
<br>talented, intelligent, and moderately successful. Almost without exception though, they fail to live up to 
<br>their full potential.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:11672px; width:264px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica-Bold; font-size:14px">&quot;But He Seemed Like Such A Nice Guy&quot;

<br>a Nice Guy for those of a healthy male. Many women have told me that upon initially meeting these

<br>the Nice Guy seemed like a real catch.

<br>relationships. As a result, </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">these men tend to swing back and forth between being nice and not-so-
<br>nice.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> I have listened to countless wives, partners and girlfriends describe the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 
<br>qualities of Nice Guys:
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:12003px; width:587px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;He can be really wonderful and he can also hurt me deeply. He&#x27;ll do all the extra little things like 
<br>picking up the kids and fixing dinner when I have to put in extra hours at work. But then out of the blue, 
<br>he&#x27;ll throw a tantrum about me never being sexually available to him.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:12073px; width:583px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;Everyone thinks he is such a great guy and I&#x27;m really lucky to have him. But they don&#x27;t know what he 
<br>can really be like. He&#x27;s always helping people out with their car or something else that needs fixing. 
<br>When I ask him to do something he tells me that he can never make me happy and that I&#x27;m nagging and 
<br>controlling like his mother.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:12159px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;He is constantly trying to please me. He will do anything for me except really be there for me. He&#x27;ll go 
<br>shopping with me even though I know he doesn&#x27;t want to. The whole time he will just sulk, which makes 
<br>me miserable. I wish he would just tell me &#x27;no&#x27; sometimes.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:12228px; width:563px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;He will never tell me when something is bothering him. He&#x27;ll just keep it in and it will build like a 
<br>pressure cooker. I won&#x27;t have a clue that anything is bothering him. And then out of the blue, he&#x27;ll 
<br>explode and we&#x27;ll end up in a big fight. If he would just tell me when he is upset about something, it 
<br>would make it a lot easier.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:12315px; width:582px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;When I try to talk to him about something that is bothering me, he tries to fix it. He thinks that if I just 
<br>did everything his way, it would solve all my problems. He always tells me I dwell on the negative and 
<br>that he can never make me happy. All I really want is for him to listen to me.&quot;

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">everyone assumes the map they are using is up-to-date and accurate.

Unfortunately, if 
<br>they are outdated or inaccurate, they can send us in the wrong direction or fruitlessly driving around the 
<br>same old neighborhood. When this happens we often keep trying harder to find our desired destination 
<br>while feeling more and more frustrated. Even though an individual following an inaccurate or outdated 
<br>paradigm may think his behavior makes perfect sense, those around him may wonder what he could 
<br>possibly be thinking to make him act the way he does.

<br>based on the inaccurate interpretations of childhood experiences. Since they are often unconscious, they 
<br>are rarely evaluated or updated. Perhaps most significantly, they are assumed to be 100 percent accurate 
<br>â even when they are not.

<br>challenged. Their inclination is to hang on to belief systems that have proven to be consistently 
<br>unworkable, yet are so embedded in their unconscious mind that to challenge them is tantamount to 
<br>heresy. It is difficult for Nice Guys to consider doing something different, even when what they are 
<br>doing isn&#x27;t working.

<br>is a good example of the frustration that can result from an ineffective Nice Guy paradigm. Jason had a 
<br>controlling, perfectionist father who put unrealistic demands on Jason and his siblings. His father 
<br>believed there was one right way to do everything â his way. Jason&#x27;s mother was an emotionally 
<br>dependent woman who lived through her children. When his mother was needy, she would smother her 
<br>kids. When the children had needs, she was often too emotionally distressed to respond.

<br>up his father&#x27;s expectations. Similarly, no matter how giving he was, his needy mother would never be 
<br>available to nurture him. He could not see that there really was no way to do everything right. And 
<br>regardless of how well he believed he hid his flaws or mistakes, people might still get angry at him.

<br>see was to just keep trying harder doing more of the same. The only thing his paradigm ever really did 
<br>was to create a distraction from his feelings of fear, worthlessness, and inadequacy.

Like his 
<br>mother, his wife was only attentive when she was emotionally needy. Like his father, she could be 
<br>critical and controlling. By applying his childhood road map to his marriage â trying to do everything 
<br>right, being attentive and nurturing, never being a moment&#x27;s problem, hiding his mistakes â Jason 
<br>created an illusion that he could get his wife to approve of him all the time, be sexually available 
<br>whenever he wanted, and never get mad at him. His defective paradigm prevented him from seeing that 
<br>no matter what he did, his wife would still at times be cold, critical, and unavailable, </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">and</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> that maybe he 
<br>needed her to be that way. Even when his paradigm was just as ineffective in adulthood as it was in 
<br>childhood, Jason&#x27;s only option seemed to be to just keep trying harder.

<br>The first is that the program of recovery presented in </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">No More Mr. Nice Guy!</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> is not just a few good 
<br>ideas to try on for size. It represents a challenge to everything Nice Guys believe about what they must 
<br>do to be loved, get their needs met, and keep their world calm.

<br>Trying to do it halfway will only result in needless suffering.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">

<br>If you are currently in a relationship, I encourage you to ask your partner to read this book along with 
<br>you. The program of recovery presented in </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">No More Mr. Nice Guy!</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> will significantly affect not only 
<br>you, but also those closest to you. Though your partner may be supportive of you making positive 
<br>changes, they may also initially frighten him or her. Reading this book together can help facilitate this 
<br>transition.

<br>answer to this question that makes sense: </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Because it does not feel safe or acceptable for a boy or man 
<br>to be just who he is.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Becoming a Nice Guy is a way of coping with situations where it does not feel safe 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">or acceptable for a boy or man to be just who he is. Further, the only thing that would make a child or an 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">adult sacrifice one&#x27;s self by trying to become something different is a belief that being just who he is

<br>their families and the world around them that it was not safe, acceptable, or desirable for them to be who 
<br>they were, just as they were.

<br>did? The following is a short course on how families and society turn perfect little boys into men who 
<br>believe they have to be &quot;good&quot; in order to be loved.

In these first few 
<br>years a child&#x27;s personality is most significantly influenced by his surroundings. It is during this time that 
<br>his paradigms begin to be established. Since the strongest influences during this time are usually a 
<br>child&#x27;s parents and extended family, this is where we must begin our examination of the origins of the 
<br>Nice Guy Syndrome.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:19200px; width:585px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">There are two important facts we must understand about children. First, when children come into the 
<br>world they are </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">totally helpless</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. They are dependent on others to recognize and respond to their needs in 
<br>a timely, judicious manner. As a result of this dependency, every child&#x27;s greatest fear is abandonment. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">To children, abandonment means death.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:19287px; width:567px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Second, children are </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">ego-centered</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. This means that they inherently believe they are the center of the 
<br>universe and everything revolves around them. Therefore, they believe that they are the </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">cause</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> of

<br>dynamic for all children. </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Whenever a child experiences any kind of abandonment he will always 
<br>believe that he is the cause of what has happened to him.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> These abandonment experiences might 
<br>include any of the following experiences:

<br>abandonment experiences. </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Even though their belief that they are the cause of these painful events is, 
<br>in fact, an inaccurate interpretation of their life, children have no other way to understand the 
<br>world.

<br>some young children that it is not acceptable for them to be who they are, just as they are. They 
<br>conclude that </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">there must be something wrong with them, which causes the important people in their lives 
<br>to abandon them</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. They have no way of comprehending that their abandonment experiences are not 
<br>caused by something about them, but by the people who are supposed to recognize and meet their needs.

<br>called </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">toxic shame</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. Toxic shame is the belief that one is inherently bad, defective, different, or 
<br>unlovable. Toxic shame is not just a belief that one does bad things, it is a deeply held core belief that 
<br>one </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">is bad</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">.

Since their insight, 
<br>experience, and resources are limited, these survival mechanisms are often ineffective and sometimes, 
<br>seemingly illogical. For instance, a child who is feeling lonely may misbehave in a way that is sure to 
<br>attract his parent&#x27;s attention in a negative way. Even though it may seem illogical for a child to do 
<br>something that invites painful or negative attention, the consequences of the behavior may not feel as 
<br>bad as feeling lonely or isolated.

<br>fit together. I believed that I came from a pretty good family and had lived a pretty good life. When I

<br>&quot;Leave It To Beaver,&quot; or &quot;All-American&quot; families. Nevertheless, these men learned to hide their flaws 
<br>and tried to become what they believed others wanted them to be. These factors indicate that at some 
<br>point in their early lives, their circumstances were less than ideal.

<br>are all unique in the way that their Nice Guy scripts are played out in their adult lives. In spite of these 
<br>differences, they all developed a core belief in childhood that they were not OK just as they were. As a 
<br>result of their internalized toxic shame, each developed a life paradigm that involved seeking approval 
<br>and hiding perceived flaws. All of these men believed that these life strategies were necessary if they 
<br>were to have any hope of being loved, getting their needs met, and having a problem-free life.

<br>herself. When he was 15, Jose had to break through a locked door and take a loaded gun away from his

<br>all Nice Guys developed survival mechanisms to help them do three very important things:

<br>lives. Even though it is based on faulty interpretations of childhood events, it is the only road map these 
<br>men have. Nice Guys believe this map is accurate, and if they follow it correctly, they should arrive at 
<br>their desired location â a smooth, happy life. </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Even though this life script is often highly ineffective, 
<br>Nice Guys frequently just keep trying harder, doing more of the same, hoping for different results.

<br>internalized toxic shame are usually manifested in one of two ways. In one form, a Nice Guy 
<br>exaggerates his belief about his &quot;not OK-ness&quot; and believes he is the worst kind of person. I call this 
<br>man the </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">&quot;I&#x27;m so bad&quot;</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Nice Guy.

He can give concrete examples 
<br>of bad behavior in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood that support his core belief about himself. He 
<br>can tell of breaking windows and getting whippings as a little boy. He will reveal running afoul of the 
<br>law and making his mother cry when he was a teenager. He will tell tales of smoking, drinking, using 
<br>drugs and carousing as an adult. He is convinced his only hope for having any kind of happiness in life 
<br>lies in trying his best to mask his inherent badness. He never really believes anyone will buy into his 
<br>Nice Guy persona, but doesn&#x27;t think he has any other choice.

This man handles his toxic shame by 
<br>repressing his core belief about his worthlessness. He believes he is one of the nicest guys you will ever 
<br>meet. If he is conscious of any perceived flaws, they are seen as minor and easily correctable. As a child 
<br>he was never a moment&#x27;s problem. As a teen he did everything right. As an adult, he follows all the rules 
<br>to a &quot;t&quot;. This Nice Guy has tucked his core belief about his &quot;not OK-ness&quot; into a handy, air-tight

<br>both operate from the same life paradigm. All Nice Guys believe they are not OK just as they are, and 
<br>therefore must hide their flaws and become what they believe other people want them to be.

Neither is 
<br>as bad or good as they believe themselves to be. They are both just wounded souls operating from a 
<br>belief system based on the inaccurate perceptions of the events of their childhood.

<br>from their sons in droves. According to the US census, in 1910 one-third of all families lived on farms. 
<br>By 1940, this number had shrunk to one in five. By 1970, 96 percent of all families lived in urban areas.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:27968px; width:589px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In an agrarian society, boys connected with their fathers by working alongside them in the fields. This 
<br>often meant contact with extended family that included grandfathers, uncles, and cousins. This daily 
<br>contact with men provided boys with an intimate model of maleness. Sons learned about being male by 
<br>watching their dads, just as their own fathers had learned by watching their fathers. As families migrated 
<br>from rural areas to cities and suburbs after World War II, the contact between fathers and sons 
<br>diminished significantly. Dads left home in the morning and went to work. Most sons never got to see 
<br>what their fathers did, let alone have much time to spend with them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:28104px; width:588px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Fathers became unavailable in other ways. Men&#x27;s addictions to work, TV, alcohol, and sex took them 
<br>away from their sons. Increases in divorce began to separate boys from their fathers. Census statistics 
<br>show that the incidence of divorce among men tripled from 1940 to 1970. In 1940, just over five million 
<br>households were headed by women. By 1970, this figure had almost tripled to over 13 million 
<br>households.

<br>relationship with their fathers in childhood.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Sometimes this was a result of their fathers working long 
<br>hours, being withdrawn, or being passive. More often than not, Nice Guys describe their fathers in 
<br>negative terms. They often see them as controlling, rageful, angry, absent, abusive, unavailable, 
<br>addictive, or philandering. </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">It is not unusual at some point in childhood for Nice Guys to have made 
<br>a conscious decision to be different from their fathers.

<br>Women inherited the defacto job of turning boys into men. Unfortunately even the most well-meaning 
<br>mothers are not equipped to teach their sons how to be men by themselves. This hasn&#x27;t kept them from 
<br>trying.

<br>result of mothers, not fathers, teaching their sons how to be male.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Consequently, many Nice Guys

In the primary grades, they make up only 15% of 
<br>the teaching staff, and that number is steadily dropping. From daycare to preschool to elementary 
<br>school, little boys in the post-war era have been surrounded by women. There have been few adult males 
<br>to help them through this experience. If a little boy was already disconnected from his father and trained 
<br>to please a woman, the typical school system magnified this conditioning.

<br>their fathers. Battle lines were drawn between young men protesting a war started and perpetuated by 
<br>their fathers. A generation of World War II veterans could not understand the flaunting of responsibility 
<br>and the social rebellion of their sons. The young men of this generation became the antithesis of their 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">fathers and of an establishment that solved domestic and international problems with guns and bombs. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The anti-war movement created a new breed of males focused on love, peace, and avoiding conflict.

<br>control provided new freedom, and women&#x27;s liberation was in its infancy. Some mothers during the 
<br>Baby Boom era could foresee a change in gender roles on the horizon. They worked to prepare their 
<br>sons and daughters for what was to come. Many of these mothers raised their daughters to not need a 
<br>man. At the same time, they trained their sons to be different from their fathers â peaceful, giving, 
<br>nurturing, and attentive to a woman&#x27;s needs.

Some feminists 
<br>claimed that men were the cause all of the problems in the world. Others asserted that men were merely 
<br>an unnecessary nuisance. More than likely, the majority of women during this era did not feel this way 
<br>about men. Nevertheless, enough angry women were significantly vocal to contribute to a social climate 
<br>that convinced many men that it was not OK to be just who they were.

Less angry 
<br>slogans of feminism asserted that &quot;a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle.&quot; Men who were 
<br>already conditioned to look to women for definition and approval were especially susceptible to these 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:13px">kinds of messages. This added incentive for these men to try to figure out what women wanted and try to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">become that in order to be loved and get their needs met.

<br>of these men are not happy. You quickly notice the lack of energy in them. They are life-preserving but

<br>that many little boys had already received from their families â that they weren&#x27;t OK just as they were. 
<br>These social events further amplified the belief that if they wanted to be loved, get their needs met, and 
<br>have a smooth life, they had to hide their flaws and become what others (especially women) wanted 
<br>them to be.

<br>with the Baby-Boom generation. I am seeing more and more young men in their twenties, and even 
<br>teens, who demonstrate all of the characteristics of the Nice Guy Syndrome. Not only have these young 
<br>men been effected by all of the social dynamics listed above, even more grew up in single parent 
<br>families or were raised by Nice Guy fathers. As I write this, I expect that we are just beginning on our 
<br>third generation of Nice Guys.

Cal tries to get external 
<br>validation by always being in a good mood, driving a nice car, dressing well, having a cute daughter, 
<br>and having an attractive wife. Let&#x27;s pick one of these attachments to illustrate how Cal tries to get

From the 
<br>moment he begins to dress her he is unconsciously attaching his value and identity to the 
<br>acknowledgment he thinks he will receive from being a &quot;good dad.&quot; He knows that when he takes his 
<br>daughter walking people will look at her and smile. Some will comment about the cute little girl and her 
<br>father out for a walk. A few will stop and ask her age and others will gush about what a precious little 
<br>angel she is. This attention makes Cal feel good about himself.

Further, his dependency on external 
<br>validation actually prevents people from getting to know him just as he is. None of these things have 
<br>anything to do with who he is as a person. Nevertheless, they are the things he believes give him identity 
<br>and value.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:34045px; width:587px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Nice Guys seek external validation in just about every social situation, but their quest for approval is the 
<br>most pronounced in their relationships with women. Nice Guys interpret a woman&#x27;s approval as the 
<br>ultimate validation of their worth. Signs of a woman&#x27;s approval can take the form of her desire to have 
<br>sex, flirtatious behavior, a smile, a touch, or attentiveness. At the other end of the spectrum, if a woman 
<br>is depressed, in a bad mood, or angry, Nice Guys interpret these things to mean that she is not accepting 
<br>or approving of them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:34165px; width:440px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">There are numerous negative consequences in seeking the approval of women.

<br>availability.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> The </span><span style="font-family: Times-BoldItalic; font-size:14px">possibility of availability</span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px"> </span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">is a term I use to describe the subjective measure of a 
<br>woman&#x27;s sexual availability. Since Nice Guys see sex as the ultimate form of acceptance, and they 
<br>believe a woman must be in a good mood before she will have sex, these men are constantly diligent to 
<br>not do anything that might upset a woman whom they desire. In addition, if a woman they desire is 
<br>angry, depressed, or in a bad mood, they believe they must do something quickly â lie, offer solutions, 
<br>sacrifice self, manipulate â to fix it.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:34337px; width:585px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The possibility of availability extends beyond just sex. Since Nice Guys have been conditioned by their 
<br>families and society to never do anything to upset a woman, they are hyper-vigilant in responding to the 
<br>moods and desires of women they don&#x27;t even plan on having sex with.

<br>constantly report that their own moods are often tied to the moods of their partner. If she is happy and 
<br>doing OK, so is he. If she is angry, depressed, or stressed, he will feel anxious until she is fixed. This 
<br>connection runs so deep that many Nice Guys have told me that they feel guilty if they are in a good

<br>woman says he is &quot;wrong&quot; or thinks he is a &quot;jerk,&quot; a Nice Guy will be inclined to believe she is right. 
<br>Even if the Nice Guy argues with the woman&#x27;s evaluation, at some level he knows that since she is the 
<br>woman, she must be right. (One Nice Guy asked me, &quot;If a man is talking in the forest and no woman is 
<br>there to hear him, is he still wrong?&quot;)

<br>women, the truth is, most of these men have tremendous rage toward women. This is because we tend to 
<br>eventually despise whatever we make into our god. When our god fails to respond in the ways we 
<br>expect, we humans tend to respond in one of two ways. We either blindly intensify our acts of worship 
<br>or lash out in righteous anger. When Nice Guys put a woman or women on a pedestal and attempt to win 
<br>their approval, sooner or later, this adoration will turn to rage when these objects of worship fail to live 
<br>up to the Nice Guys&#x27; expectations. This is why it is not unusual to hear a Nice Guy proclaim his undying 
<br>love to a woman in one breath and then ragefully call her a &quot;f . . . c . . .&quot; only moments later.

<br>approval. As long as the gay Nice Guy can convince himself that he is not sexually attracted to women, 
<br>he can delude himself into thinking that women don&#x27;t have any power over him.

One way to begin this process is 
<br>to pay attention when trying to impress or get approval. Recovering Nice Guys can observe themselves 
<br>spending extra time on their hair, holding the door open for someone, cleaning the kitchen, or walking 
<br>with their child in the park â just to get noticed or praised.

<br>begin living an </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">inside-out kind of life</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">. This means, rather than focusing outward for acceptance and 
<br>approval, they turn inward. In doing so, they can begin asking themselves the important questions: 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-BoldItalic; font-size:14px">&quot;What do I want,&quot; &quot;What feels right to me,&quot; &quot;What would make me happy?&quot;

<br>outside of themselves to get value. During a session of individual therapy, I asked Cal to make a list of 
<br>things he used to get approval from others. The next week he brought in a two-page list. I encouraged 
<br>him to pick one attachment from the list and for the next month, pay attention to how he used it to get 
<br>value.

Cal kept his car perfectly clean, inside and out. He believed this was one 
<br>of the things that impressed people and made them like him. He made a conscious decision to not wash

<br>people responded to him.

Surprisingly enough, 
<br>during the month, not one person had commented on his dirty car and no one had quit liking him or 
<br>removed their love from him. Likewise, washing and waxing his car after a month didn&#x27;t make anyone 
<br>like him better or garner him any new friends.

<br>decided to spend $2,000 dollars to join a singles activity club. He shared with the group that even though 
<br>he occasionally heard a little voice that said he wasn&#x27;t worth it, doing so was one of the most affirming 
<br>things he had ever done. A couple of months later, he reported that he had gone on two dates with two 
<br>different women, both of whom seemed to like him just as he was.

<br>affects of affirmations are usually short-lived. This is because these messages are contrary to the oldest,

<br>other processes that help change the Nice Guy&#x27;s core beliefs.

<br>When alone, Nice Guys can discover who they are, what they like about themselves, and what rules they 
<br>choose to govern their lives. I strongly recommend that Nice Guys take trips and retreats by themselves 
<br>to places where no one knows them. In this context, the Nice Guy has fewer reasons to try to win 
<br>people&#x27;s approval, and there is less of a need to try to hide faults and mistakes. While alone, Nice Guys 
<br>can reflect on themselves and their life direction. It is also a good time to practice taking responsibility 
<br>for one&#x27;s needs.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:41491px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">When alone, the recovering Nice Guy can do what he wants without having to please or compromise. He 
<br>will go to bed and get up when he wants. He will decide when and what to eat. He will decide where he 
<br>goes and what he does. When alone he will be less likely to caretake, seek approval, sacrifice self, or try 
<br>to fix someone&#x27;s problems.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:41577px; width:588px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Spending extended periods of time alone also helps recovering Nice Guys face their number one fear â 
<br>loneliness and isolation. When the Nice Guy discovers that spending time alone doesn&#x27;t kill him, he may 
<br>also realize that he doesn&#x27;t have to stay in bad relationships, tolerate intolerable behavior, or manipulate 
<br>people to try to get his needs met.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:41664px; width:591px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">This time alone is spent most effectively when the Nice Guy can observe his tendency to distract himself 
<br>with addictive patterns such as keeping busy, or using sex, food, or alcohol to medicate. Writing in a 
<br>journal during these times can be especially effective. Some of the most insightful periods I have 
<br>experienced in life have been by myself on weekend camping trips, week-long retreats, and times when 
<br>my wife has been out of town.

<br>and unlovable. Changing this core belief requires that they bring their humanity out into the open, 
<br>release their toxic shame, and receive more accurate messages than the ones internalized in childhood. 
<br>By necessity, this process requires a safe person or safe people.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:42271px; width:568px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As frightening as it may initially feel, finding these safe people is essential for learning to approve of 
<br>self. The recovering Nice Guy cannot do this part alone. Safe people are essential for reversing the 
<br>distorted beliefs all Nice Guys have about their worth.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:42340px; width:588px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">This process requires building trust. I suggest that the recovering Nice Guy set a regular time to meet 
<br>with his safe person or group, and a little at a time, start revealing himself. This process begins by just 
<br>talking about himself. This in itself makes many Nice Guys uncomfortable. Over time, the recovering 
<br>Nice Guy can begin revealing the things about himself that he is the least comfortable letting others see. 
<br>Once trust has been established, he can begin to reveal things about himself that create fear and shame. I 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">have watched many Nice Guys go from being secretive and evasive to revealing their deepest, darkest 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">secrets in the presence of safe people.

<br>process.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:42529px; width:576px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Reid came into a group late one evening and remained quiet and detached for the first thirty or forty 
<br>minutes. Reid&#x27;s pattern in the group was to either join in actively or stay withdrawn. His quiet periods 
<br>were often a signal that he was emotionally distraught. When an opportune time arose, I told Reid that 
<br>he seemed withdrawn and I asked how he was doing.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:42616px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Once the attention of the group focused on him, his appearance shifted from detachment to terror. &quot;I 
<br>almost didn&#x27;t come tonight.&quot; He whispered softly as he looked down at his hands. &quot;In fact, I was thinking 
<br>about quitting the group.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:42685px; width:517px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">A couple of the guys reflected the concern of the whole group by asking what was going on.

<br>against him. One of the group members asked if he was having an affair.

<br>it.&quot;

<br>again. He had been clean and sober since joining the group six months earlier. He was active in AA, but 
<br>had experienced a number of slips and relapses in his 12 years of recovery. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:43193px; width:566px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">A group member handed him a box of tissues and Reid wiped his eyes. He then continued telling his 
<br>story and revealing his shame in between sobs.

He shook his head and shared 
<br>that he had slipped so many times that he didn&#x27;t think anyone would care or want him back.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:43334px; width:577px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Various members of the group shared with Reid that they didn&#x27;t think he was bad nor did they have 
<br>judgment of him. They could see that he was hurting. They told him that they had great respect that he 
<br>came into group and revealed what was going on, especially since he had so much shame about it.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:43404px; width:584px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">After a few moments, Reid revealed, &quot;That&#x27;s not all. There&#x27;s more.&quot; He began to sob once again. Lifting 
<br>his hand to his forehead he shook his head as in disgust for himself.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:43456px; width:581px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;It gets worse. I went to the peep shows near my work two times this week.&quot; He turned his eyes to the 
<br>floor and wept almost uncontrollably. &quot;I had been doing so good.&quot; he choked out between sobs, &quot;Now 
<br>I&#x27;ve blown it all. I feel totally worthless and don&#x27;t want to go on living. I&#x27;ve made a mess of everything.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:43526px; width:577px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">For the rest of the hour, the group supported Reid and encouraged him to go all the way through his 
<br>shame. They reassured him that he wasn&#x27;t bad and that no one had judgment of him. To the contrary, 
<br>everyone respected him for revealing his shame and pain. They supported him in talking to his wife, 
<br>calling his sponsor and going to a meeting. They asked him to call one group member each day during 
<br>the next week and let them know how he was doing.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:43629px; width:587px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">When Reid left the group that night, he was obviously shaken and scared. He had also released a heavy 
<br>burden and received the support of a group of people who genuinely cared about him and wanted him to 
<br>be OK. No matter how deeply Reid feared that his badness would cause people to judge him and 
<br>abandon him, neither of these things happened. Instead, he received the message that there was nothing 
<br>he could do that would make the men in the group stop liking him or stop caring about him.

<br>reality that they are human. Like every other human, Nice Guys make mistakes, use poor judgment, and 
<br>act inappropriately. Nevertheless, their humanity doesn&#x27;t make them bad or unlovable nor does it cause 
<br>other people to stop loving them.

<br>individuals who have some substance and sense of self. Chameleons usually don&#x27;t draw much of a crowd 
<br>or get many ovations.

<br>experience the intimacy and connection they have always desired. By learning to approve of themselves, 
<br>they begin to radiate a life energy and charisma that draws people to them. As Nice Guys stop seeking 
<br>approval and stop trying to hide their perceived flaws, they open a door to start getting what they really 
<br>want in love and life.

Lars had 
<br>come to see me on the encouragement of his wife. He reported being generally depressed and unhappy 
<br>for as long as he could remember. In recent months he had found it difficult to sleep at night and was 
<br>experiencing migraine headaches on a regular basis. Even though everything in his life seemed to be 
<br>&quot;fine&quot; â good job, nice home, family, etc. â he never seemed to be happy.

<br>disappearing to somewhere else in the world. These thoughts made him feel guilty, so he kept them to 
<br>himself.

<br>responsibility for finding ways to meet them. This discussion was met with both fear and resistance from 
<br>Lars. The same hesitancy was repeated as he began his second counseling session.

Nice Guys generally focus their attention 
<br>on meeting everyone else&#x27;s needs while trying to be &quot;low maintenance&quot; kinds of guys themselves. When 
<br>I talk with them about making their needs a priority, their response is similar to that of Lars.

When a child&#x27;s needs 
<br>are not met in a timely, healthy manner, the child may come to believe he is &quot;bad&quot; for having needs. He 
<br>may also think that it is his needs that cause people to hurt him or abandon him. Typically Nice Guys 
<br>respond to these inaccurate interpretations of their life events by developing a number of survival 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">mechanisms.

<br>childhood abandonment experiences. Since it was when they had the most needs that they felt the most 
<br>abandoned, they believed it was their needs that drove people away.

<br>would abandon them. They also convinced themselves that if they didn&#x27;t have needs, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt so 
<br>bad when the needs weren&#x27;t met. Not only did they learn early not to expect to get their needs met, but 
<br>also that their very survival seemed to depend on appearing not to have needs.

<br>alive, and they could not meet their needs on their own. The only logical solution was to try to appear to 
<br>be needless and wantless while trying to get needs met in indirect and covert ways.

<br>getting their needs met contradicts their childhood paradigms, Nice Guys are extremely uncomfortable 
<br>when they actually do get what they want. Though most Nice Guys have a difficult time grasping this 
<br>concept, they are terrified of getting what they really want and will go to extreme measures to make sure 
<br>they don&#x27;t. Nice Guys carry out this unconscious agenda by connecting with needy or unavailable 
<br>people, operating from an unspoken agenda, being unclear and indirect, pushing people away, and 
<br>sabotaging.

<br>Many of the Nice Guys I&#x27;ve worked with have expressed a heightened interest in sex, yet they frequently 
<br>feel frustrated in their attempts to get these needs met. This is usually because their actions pretty much 
<br>guarantee that they won&#x27;t get what they believe they want.

<br>negative experiences with sex, tend to have a difficult time being sexually expressive. When these 
<br>partners do make themselves available to be sexual, it is not uncommon for Nice Guys to do something 
<br>that further ensures that they don&#x27;t get their needs met. The Nice Guy may respond by taking control 
<br>rather than letting the sexual experience unfold. He may focus on his partner&#x27;s sexual needs before she 
<br>has a chance to pay attention to him. He might start a fight by making a comment about her weight or 
<br>her past unavailability. All of these strategies pretty much ensure that the Nice Guy won&#x27;t have to 
<br>experience the fear, shame, or anxiety that might get triggered if he actually allowed someone to focus 
<br>on his needs.

<br>caretaking. Nice Guys believe their caretaking is fundamentally loving and is one of the things that 
<br>makes them good people. In reality, caretaking has nothing to do with being loving or good. Caretaking 
<br>is an immature and indirect attempt to try to get one&#x27;s needs met.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">caretake in their intimate relationships. Reese, who is gay, lamented in one of his therapy sessions, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;Why can&#x27;t I find a partner who gives as much back to me as I give to him?&quot; He went on to describe how 
<br>all of his boyfriends seemed to be takers and that he always did all of the giving. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:49228px; width:571px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Within a period of a year, Reese entered into three intense relationships. Each began wonderfully and 
<br>seemed like the partnership he had been looking for. Each failed because of the same scenario: Reese 
<br>picked men who needed rescuing or fixing.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:49298px; width:586px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The first boyfriend lived in Canada and had recently gotten off drugs. He came to live with Reese but 
<br>never applied for a work visa and struggled to stay clean. Reese went out of his way to be supportive of 
<br>his boyfriend with the hope that he would find a job and stay off drugs. Finally, Reese sent him home to 
<br>get his life straightened out. Later, he found out from a mutual friend that the reason his boyfriend had 
<br>never applied for a work visa was because he was HIV positive, something he failed to tell Reese.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:49401px; width:586px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The next boyfriend was of a different race from Reese and had never come to grips with his 
<br>homosexuality. His parents and religion kept him in constant conflict. He was never able to commit to 
<br>the relationship. Nevertheless, Reese went out of his way to be supportive and giving, all with the hopes 
<br>that his boyfriend would eventually get things straightened out and become available to Reese.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:49487px; width:590px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The third boyfriend was in the military. He was living on base, some 40 miles from Reese&#x27;s apartment 
<br>and had no car. Reese had to take the initiative in getting together and would often shuttle his partner 
<br>around. Because Reese made more money, he always paid when they went out. Reese frequently bought 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:13px">his boyfriend gifts and loaned him money. When this boyfriend got transferred to a different state, Reese 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">quit his job, sold his car, and moved along with him, only to return in three months because his partner 
<br>started running around on him.

<br>boyfriends, he gave up his job and alienated most of his friends and family. Reese&#x27;s caretaking allowed

<br>to fix others. As is true for most Nice Guys, no matter how much he gave to others, Reese never felt like 
<br>he got as much back in return.

For them, 
<br>even the most innocuous and subtle act often has some string attached. Nice Guys give in the ways they 
<br>would like others to give to them. They give gifts, affection, back rubs, sex, surprises. They will 
<br>encourage their partner to take a day off, buy a new outfit, go to the doctor, take a trip, quit a job, go 
<br>back to school â yet would not give themselves permission to do any of the same things.

<br>passive-aggressive behavior, pouting, tantrums, withdrawing, shaming, criticizing, blaming, even 
<br>physical abuse. Once the cycle has been completed, it usually just begins all over again.

<br>tantrum. Sometimes the victim puke will take a more passive-aggressive form in which the Nice Guy 
<br>will have an affair or act out in some hidden way. All the while the person doing the puking will feel 
<br>justified because of the many ways he has been victimized. These victim pukes are one of the primary 
<br>reasons Nice Guys aren&#x27;t always so nice.

<br>puking. Shane had Racquel on a pedestal and deep inside, he believed she could only love him if he was 
<br>&quot;good enough.&quot; In order to win her love he gave her gifts, sent her cards, left phone messages, bought 
<br>her clothes, planned special surprises, and helped with her home and children.

She felt like she could never repay 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Shane for everything he did for her. The truth was â she couldn&#x27;t. Shane was trying to buy her love â 
<br>only the contract wasn&#x27;t clear. In time, the only way she could cope with his pleasing and caretaking was 
<br>by pushing him away.

He couldn&#x27;t understand why if he had fulfilled his end of the 
<br>contract, Racquel wouldn&#x27;t keep hers. He didn&#x27;t think he was that hard to please. The more Shane gave to 
<br>Racquel, the more resentful he became. He would accuse her of not loving him. They would have 
<br>tremendous battles in which they would break up, calling each other all kinds of names. Afterwards 
<br>Shane would feel frightened and remorseful and pursue Racquel and try to fix things (all the while 
<br>resenting her for not pursuing him and trying to fix things). He would then start caretaking and pleasing 
<br>again to win her love. The cycle repeated itself over and over again.

<br>make getting their needs met a priority. Sometimes I have to repeat this truth many times in order for it 
<br>to sink in. For Nice Guys, having needs means being &quot;needy,&quot; and needy represents a one-way ticket to 
<br>abandonment.

Helpless, whiny, wimpy, and needy are not 
<br>attractive on a man. Confidence and self-assurance are. Most folks are attracted to men who have a sense 
<br>of self. Putting the self first doesn&#x27;t drive people away, it attracts them. Putting the self first is essential 
<br>for getting what one wants in love and life.

<br>It is essential not only for getting needs met, but also for reclaiming personal power, feeling fully alive, 
<br>and experiencing love and intimacy.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:53192px; width:585px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Interestingly enough, when Nice Guys take responsibility for their own needs and make them a priority, 
<br>those around them benefit too. Gone are the covert contracts, the guessing games, the anger outbursts, 
<br>and passive-aggressive behavior. Gone are the manipulation, the controlling behavior, and the 
<br>resentment. I learned this lesson first-hand a few years back.

I tried to plan some 
<br>time with my wife Elizabeth, but she seemed ambivalent and unwilling to make a commitment to what 
<br>she wanted to do. I felt frustrated and put my plans on hold. Finally, upon the urging of a friend, I 
<br>decided to try putting myself first over the weekend. I made plans and invited my wife to join me if she 
<br>felt inclined. I did several things I wanted, including spending some time with friends. As it turned out, 
<br>Elizabeth decided to join me on a number of occasions. On Monday, she shared with me that she had 
<br>thoroughly enjoyed the weekend and didn&#x27;t want it to end.

<br>members to experiment with putting themselves first for at least a week. Though the challenge created 
<br>tremendous anxiety for all of the men, each decided to accept it. The experiences of three of Lars, Reese, 
<br>and Shane are presented below.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:53425px; width:80px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica-Bold; font-size:14px">A Challenge

<br>going to make his needs a priority for the following week. She was initially resistant to his proclamation 
<br>â which added to his anxiety. To boost his courage, Lars called a couple of men in the group. Their 
<br>encouragement gave him the support he needed to follow through with his commitment.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:53680px; width:591px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Lars decided to keep it simple. His plan for the week involved making time every day to go the gym and 
<br>work out. Before his children were born, Lars had been physically active. The demands of job, home and 
<br>children had put an end to that. Lars decided to alternate his workouts before and after work. When he 
<br>shared his plan with his wife, she applied a little guilt. &quot;That&#x27;s not fair that you get to work out and I 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:13px">don&#x27;t,&quot; she proclaimed. Lars was tempted to back down. He had an impulse to try to find a solution so 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">his wife could work out too. Instead, he reflected her concern and told her he was going to work out 
<br>anyway.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:53817px; width:582px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">During his first couple of trips to the gym, Lars was overwhelmed with guilt and anxiety. Nevertheless, 
<br>he persevered. After the third day, his wife actually asked him how his workout went. As the week

<br>enjoyed being around other people at the gym who were also taking good care of themselves. 
<br>Surprisingly, after his first week, his wife told him that he had inspired her to start taking better care of 
<br>herself. She told him that she was going to start dropping the kids off at the daycare center at the gym 
<br>and begin an aerobics class for herself.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:54114px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Reese had joined the No More Mr. Nice Guy! group after his break-up with his last boyfriend. At first he 
<br>had been uncomfortable being the only gay man in the group, but the other men accepted him and he 
<br>had begun to work on developing non-sexual relationships with men.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:54183px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Reese&#x27;s habit on weekends was to go to out with his latest boyfriend to gay bars on Friday, Saturday, and 
<br>Sunday nights. By Monday morning, he was exhausted. He would spend the rest of the week playing 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">catch up. Reese was afraid that if he didn&#x27;t go out whenever his boyfriend wanted, his boyfriend would 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">leave him.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:54270px; width:589px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Reese decided that for one weekend, he would put himself first and do what felt right to him. He told his 
<br>boyfriend in advance. Reese decided that he would go out just one night, not drink, and be in by 
<br>midnight. On Saturday, he made some plans to go to a movie with a couple of guys in the group. On 
<br>Sunday he stayed at home to relax and get caught up on some house cleaning and laundry. His goal was 
<br>to be in bed by 10:00 p.m. on Sunday evening.

His boyfriend hadn&#x27;t dropped him, and 
<br>the rest of the week felt productive and enjoyable.

Shane regularly gave 
<br>her gifts, planned surprises, and did whatever he could to help her out.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:54524px; width:583px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Shane&#x27;s plan for putting himself first involved paying attention to when he had an impulse to do 
<br>something for his girlfriend. Whenever he felt this impulse, he would instead do something for himself. 
<br>When he thought about washing her car, he washed his own instead. When he felt the urge to buy her a 
<br>gift, he bought himself something instead. When he thought about calling her just to see if she was OK, 
<br>he called a group member instead. All of this created tremendous anxiety for Shane.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:54627px; width:585px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Much to his surprise, at the end of the week Racquel reported she felt a lot less smothered by Shane and 
<br>actually looked forward to spending time with him. She even called late one evening after the kids were 
<br>in bed and invited him over to make love. 
<br></span></div><span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:54780px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>

<br>They decided to continue the process. For a period of six months they agreed that Shane would not give 
<br>any gifts or plan any surprises for Racquel. During the following six months he refrained from giving 
<br>her birthday, Christmas, and Valentine&#x27;s cards or gifts. During this time he focused on taking better care 
<br>of himself and getting his needs met.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:54912px; width:591px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In time Shane came to see that not only did Racquel not stop loving him, she actually became more 
<br>giving to Shane. One year latter, they both reported that Shane could give a gift without using it as a way 
<br>to get approval or affirmation. During this time, Shane had also learned that making his needs a priority 
<br>made him less dependent, needy, and fearful. Both Shane and Racquel reported enjoying all the changes 
<br>they had experienced since Shane made the decision to start putting himself first.

Actually doing it is relatively easy. When the 
<br>Nice Guy puts himself first there is only one voice to consider â his own. Decisions are now made by 
<br>one individual, rather than by a committee. He no longer has to mind read, predict, or try to please 
<br>multiple voices with conflicting agendas. When putting himself first all the information he needs to 
<br>make a decision is within him: &quot;Is this what I want? Yes. Then that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do.&quot;

<br>something I had done. Like many of our arguments, Elizabeth felt helpless to get me to see my denial. 
<br>At the same time, I felt unjustly persecuted. Finally, when the argument reached an emotional crescendo, 
<br>Elizabeth shouted in frustration,

This may not sound like a nice thing to say, but it&#x27;s true. Nice Guys tend to be 
<br>wimpy victims because their life paradigm and childhood survival mechanisms require them to sacrifice 
<br>their personal power.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:57806px; width:590px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As stated in previous chapters, a common denominator for Nice Guys is that they did not get their needs 
<br>met in a timely, healthy fashion in childhood. These little boys were helpless to prevent people from 
<br>abandoning them, neglecting them, abusing them, using them, or smothering them. They </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">were</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> victims to 
<br>the people who failed to love them, pay attention to them, meet their needs, and protect them.

These 
<br>men tend to see others as causing the problems they are experiencing in life. As a consequence, they 
<br>often feel frustrated, helpless, resentful, and rageful. You can see it in their body language. You can hear 
<br>it in their voices.

<br>paradigm: &quot;If I am good, then I will be loved, get my needs met, and have a problem-free life.&quot; 
<br>Unfortunately, this paradigm not only produces the opposite of what is desired, it guarantees nothing but 
<br>feelings of perpetual powerlessness.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:58379px; width:590px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Even though Nice Guys are obsessed with trying to create a smooth, problem-free life, two major factors 
<br>prevent them from attaining this goal. The first is that they are attempting the impossible. Life is </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">not</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> 
<br>smooth. Human existence is by nature chaotic. Life is filled with experiences that are unpredictable and 
<br>beyond anyone&#x27;s control. Therefore, trying to create a predictable life in which everything always goes 
<br>as planned is an exercise in futility.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:58482px; width:583px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In spite of the fact that we live in a chaotic, unpredictable world, Nice Guys are not only convinced that 
<br>life can be smooth, they believe it </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">should</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> be. This belief is the direct result of their childhood 
<br>abandonment experiences. The unpredictability of not having their needs met in a timely, judicious 
<br>fashion was not only frightening, it was potentially life-threatening.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:58568px; width:590px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">In attempt to cope with the uncertainty of their chaotic childhood, Nice Guys developed a belief 
<br>system that if they could just do everything right, then everything would go right in their lives.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> 
<br>Sometimes these men also developed belief systems that their childhood was ideal and problem-free (the 
<br>opposite of reality) in order to cope with their abandonment experiences. These were all distorted 
<br>beliefs, but these illusions helped these helpless little boys deal with the turmoil that was out of their 
<br>control.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:58688px; width:580px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">A second reason Nice Guys never accomplish their goal of having a smooth life is that they do the 
<br>opposite of what works. By approaching adult situations with survival mechanisms that were formed 
<br>when they were naive and powerless, they are insured of having very little success in creating anything 
<br>that resembles stability in their lives.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:58774px; width:579px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The dependence on these ineffective survival mechanisms keeps Nice Guys trapped in the memory of 
<br>their fearful childhood experiences and perpetuates a vicious cycle. The more frightened they are, the 
<br>more they use their childhood survival mechanisms. The more they use these ineffective mechanisms, 
<br>the less successful they are at negotiating the complexities, challenges and ambiguities of life. The less 
<br>successful they are, the more fearful they become . . . you get the picture.

<br>relationship might not be about Barb. He began looking at his own caretaking and controlling behavior. 
<br>He also became aware that he had few outside interests and no male friends. After a couple more 
<br>months, he joined a No More Mr. Nice Guy! men&#x27;s group.

<br>making Barb better. It was a slow process, but Gil began to see that he could not do anything to change 
<br>Barb and that he was going to have to focus on himself. As he began to let go and detach from Barb he

<br>wife, Les revealed how Sarah had gained 60 pounds since they married, refused to cook, was depressed, 
<br>no longer wanted to have sex with him, treated him with contempt, and would rage at him without 
<br>provocation. In spite of all these things, Les maintained that his wife was the woman of his dreams and 
<br>that he loved her dearly.

<br>his wife and his relationship with her. This was a slow and difficult process. Les needed to see Sarah in a 
<br>certain way because of his fear of being alone. To dwell in reality might mean he would have to do 
<br>something frightening or difficult.

<br>change allowed him to start asking for what he wanted, set boundaries, and express his feelings of 
<br>resentment and anger. It soon became apparent that Sarah had no desire to look at her role in the 
<br>relationship or make any kind of changes. Though it was painful and frightening, accepting things as 
<br>they really were allowed Les to make the decision to move out and file for divorce.

<br>share what I was feeling. Like most Nice Guys, I had come to see feelings as a dangerous thing. After 30 
<br>plus years of conditioning, I had no clue what Elizabeth wanted from me. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:62454px; width:590px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Even as I began to become aware of my feelings, I often kept them to myself. It is almost comical how 
<br>infrequently it crosses a Nice Guy&#x27;s mind to tell his partner what he is feeling. On one occasion 
<br>Elizabeth confronted me when I shared a feeling with her that I had been harboring for some time. &quot;Why 
<br>didn&#x27;t you tell me about that when you first felt it?&quot; she questioned. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:62540px; width:569px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;I&#x27;m doing better,&quot; I replied in typical Nice Guy fashion. &quot;It only took me two weeks to get around to

<br>hurt anyone. The truth is they are covering their own butts. What they are really saying is that they don&#x27;t 
<br>want to do anything that might recreate their childhood experiences. They&#x27;re really not trying to protect 
<br>anyone from harm, they&#x27;re just trying to keep their world smooth and under control.

<br>a Nice Guy is feeling anxious, helpless, shameful, lonely, rageful, or sad, his feelings aren&#x27;t life-
<br>threatening. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:62748px; width:583px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The goal of teaching Nice Guys to embrace their feelings is not to make them soft and &quot;touchy-feely.&quot; 
<br>Men who are in touch with their feelings are powerful, assertive, and energized. Contrary to what many 
<br>Nice Guys believe, they don&#x27;t have to become more like women in order to have their feelings. This is 
<br>why I support men in learning about their feelings from other men.

<br>teach, model, and support this slow, but important process. In a sense, a therapy group can become like a 
<br>family. In this environment, recovering Nice Guys can ask for the kind of help in dealing with feelings 
<br>that was never available to them as children. Since feelings are often messy, a group environment can 
<br>represent a supportive place to momentarily feel out of control. Here, recovering Nice Guys find out 
<br>they won&#x27;t fall overboard and drown if they rock the boat. They also learn that they won&#x27;t shrivel up and 
<br>die if someone else around them has a feeling.

Elizabeth came to me one day 
<br>and revealed that she had backed into a parked car. She felt like a bad little child and waited for me to 
<br>scold her. Even before I had a chance to respond, she began to put up a wall and withdraw as a way of 
<br>protecting herself.

<br>my feelings clearly and directly. Without shaming or attacking I said &quot;Stop.&quot; With an intensity of 
<br>emotion that surprised both of us, I let her know that I wasn&#x27;t pushing her away and I wasn&#x27;t going to 
<br>accept her pushing me away. I told her that I did have feelings about the car, but I had even stronger 
<br>feelings about how she was acting. I said, &quot;Just let me have my feelings about the car, and then we&#x27;ll 
<br>work it out.&quot;

<br>feelings. She was able to hear that I was upset about the car but that I didn&#x27;t think she was bad and I 
<br>wasn&#x27;t going to abandon her. The fact that I had such intensity about not letting her push me away 
<br>actually made her feel secure and loved. As a result, she felt safe to stay connected to me and hear my 
<br>feelings about the car. The whole incident brought us closer and has since provided a reference point for 
<br>the healing power of expressing emotions in powerful and direct ways.

<br>recommendation of a friend. He had been separated from his wife for a year but was having a difficult 
<br>time making a final decision about getting divorced.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:64576px; width:588px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Nolan frequently told me he was &quot;confused.&quot; This confusion was mixed with a strong dose of guilt. 
<br>Nolan constantly weighed all the issues. What if he left his wife and later realized that it was a mistake? 
<br>What if he messed up his kids&#x27; lives? What if his children never wanted to talk to him again? What if his 
<br>friends thought he was bad? What if God sent him to hell? As long as Nolan stayed &quot;confused&quot; about 
<br>what he should do, he remained paralyzed.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:64679px; width:581px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">When I told Nolan that I didn&#x27;t think he was confused but that he was afraid, he was initially defensive. 
<br>He didn&#x27;t like seeing himself as being fearful. As we explored the memory fear from his childhood, he 
<br>came to realize that any mistakes he made as a child seemed to have everlasting consequences. He 
<br>believed the same would be true in his present situation.

<br>whatever happened. Together we brainstormed all the possible consequences of divorcing his wife.

Every time the Nice Guy confronts a 
<br>fear, he unconsciously creates a belief that he can handle whatever it is he is afraid of. This challenges 
<br>his memory fear. Challenging this memory fear makes the things outside of him seem less threatening. 
<br>As these things seem less frightening, he feels more confident in confronting them. The more this 
<br>confidence grows, the less threatening life seems.

<br>fundamentally dishonest. They have the ability to tell a lie or withhold the truth and still believe the 
<br>illusion that they are basically honest people. Since dishonesty is a fear-based behavior, telling lies and 
<br>withholding the truth robs Nice Guys of their personal power.

This may seem evident to most people, but it is important 
<br>to define &quot;lying,&quot; and &quot;telling the truth,&quot; because Nice Guys are adept at creating definitions that justify 
<br>their behavior. It is not unusual to hear them make statements like &quot;I&#x27;m pretty honest&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m honest 
<br>most of the time&quot; without the slightest awareness of their contradiction of terms. In almost a childlike 
<br>manner, Nice Guys will often offer the following defense: &quot;I didn&#x27;t lie, I just didn&#x27;t tell everything.&quot;

<br>his whereabouts, it never crossed his mind that he was lying to himself and to his wife. The bottom line 
<br>was that Joel&#x27;s lying perpetuated a fear-based relationship with his wife and robbed him of his personal 
<br>power.

<br>want others to know, what they least want to reveal. These are the things they are most likely to hold 
<br>back â and the things they most need to tell. Sometimes they have to practice telling a certain truth 
<br>several times until all of these pieces of information get told.

<br>with anger. Telling the truth is not a magic formula for having a smooth life. But living a life of integrity 
<br>is actually easier than living one built around deceit and distortion.

<br>on trying to guess what everyone else would think is right. Following this committee approach is the 
<br>quickest path to confusion, fear, powerlessness, and dishonesty.

<br>he is also out of integrity. Only by asking himself what he believes is right and then doing it does he

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:66630px; width:575px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Boundaries are essential for survival. Learning to set boundaries allows Nice Guys to stop feeling like 
<br>helpless victims and reclaim their personal power. Boundary setting is one of the most fundamental 
<br>skills I teach to recovering Nice Guys.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:66700px; width:589px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I demonstrate the concept of boundaries by laying a shoestring on the ground. I tell the Nice Guy that I 
<br>am going to cross his boundary and push him backwards. I instruct him to stop me when he begins to 
<br>feel uncomfortable. It is not unusual for a Nice Guy to stand well back from the line, allowing me to 
<br>violate his space several steps before he even begins to respond. Once I start pushing, it&#x27;s not uncommon 
<br>for a Nice Guy to let me push him back several steps before he does anything to stop me. Sometimes a 
<br>Nice Guy will let me push him all the way to the wall.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:66820px; width:585px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I use this exercise as a graphic demonstration of the need for boundaries in all areas of life. Nice Guys 
<br>are usually more comfortable back-pedaling, giving in, and keeping the peace. They believe if they take 
<br>one more step backward, the other person will quit pushing, and then everything will be smooth.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:66889px; width:590px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">It is not unusual for recovering Nice Guys to go a little overboard when they first learn about boundary 
<br>setting. They have a tendency to swing from one extreme to another. They become Kamikaze boundary 
<br>setters. They try to set boundaries with a sledge hammer or machete. They usually learn in time that they 
<br>only have to use as much resistance as necessary to get the job done.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:66975px; width:572px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In time, they also learn that boundary setting isn&#x27;t about getting other people to be different, but about 
<br>getting themselves to be different. If someone is crossing their boundary, it isn&#x27;t the other person&#x27;s 
<br>problem, it is theirs.

<br>intolerable. </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Due to their childhood conditioning, they teach the people around them that they will 
<br>accept having their boundaries violated.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> As recovering Nice Guys begin to take responsibility for how 
<br>they let people treat them, their own behavior begins to change. As they stop reinforcing things they 
<br>aren&#x27;t willing to tolerate, the people around them are given the opportunity to behave differently. This 
<br>gives relationships a chance to survive and grow.

Because Jake 
<br>didn&#x27;t want to lose her, he forgave her and promised to never bring up her infidelity. This established a 
<br>pattern of Kisha pretty much doing whatever she wanted while Jake withheld his feelings and walked on 
<br>eggshells. He would always measure his words in order to avoid saying anything &quot;wrong&quot; that might 
<br>upset her.

<br>too much to drink she would become belligerent and promiscuous. On this occasion she made several 
<br>demeaning remarks to Jake and spent most of the evening slow dancing with other men in the bar.

<br>The group members lovingly confronted him. They pointed out how his willingness to tolerate his wife&#x27;s 
<br>intolerable behavior gave her a license to act in any way she pleased. They told Jake that the problem 
<br>was not Kisha, it was him. Until Jake changed, his wife would have no incentive to change. By not 
<br>setting boundaries he was robbing his marriage of the opportunity to become what it could be.

He acknowledged his role in their situation. He told her that he 
<br>was no longer going to tolerate intolerable behavior. He told her his boundaries. He would no longer 
<br>tolerate Kisha dancing or flirting with other men. He would not tolerate her demeaning him in front of 
<br>their friends. He told her that if she wanted to stay married to him, she had to go to treatment for her 
<br>drinking problem.

She packed a bag and 
<br>moved out that night to a friend&#x27;s house. Even though Jake was miserable the next few days, he resisted 
<br>the temptation to call her and beg her to come back. Instead, he called some guys in the group.

She came over and told Jake that even 
<br>though she initially wanted to tell him to go to hell, she knew he was right. For the first time in their 
<br>marriage, she said she felt respect for him. She said she wanted to save their marriage and was willing to 
<br>do whatever it took to make it work. The following week Kisha entered treatment.

<br>history in which it was not always a good thing to be male. This was primarily the result of two 
<br>significant family and social changes in the post war era: 1) boys were disconnected from their fathers 
<br>and other healthy male role models, and 2) boys were forced to seek approval from women and accept a 
<br>female definition of what it meant to be male.

<br>any negative male traits (like those of their fathers or other &quot;bad&quot; men) and become what they believed 
<br>women wanted them to be. For many men, this life strategy seemed essential if they wanted to be loved, 
<br>get their needs met, and have a smooth life.

<br>distorted thinking usually began in childhood when they tried to be different from their &quot;bad&quot; or 
<br>unavailable father. In adulthood, Nice Guys often create a similar dynamic with men in general. Nice 
<br>Guys may convince themselves they are different from (better than) other men because they believe:

<br>approval of women. This seems logical considering the anti-male climate that has permeated our culture 
<br>since the 1960s. Ironically, these same men frequently complain that women seemed to be attracted to 
<br>&quot;jerks&quot; rather than Nice Guys like them. Many women have shared with me that due to the absence of 
<br>any discernible life energy in Nice Guys, there is little to be attracted to. They also reveal that their 
<br>tendency to be attracted to &quot;jerks&quot; is because these men have more of a masculine edge to them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:71803px; width:588px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As Nice Guys try to avoid the dark side of their masculinity, they also repress many other aspects of this 
<br>male energy force. As a result, they often lose their sexual assertiveness, competitiveness, creativity, 
<br>ego, thirst for experience, boisterousness, exhibitionism, and power. Go watch little boys on the 
<br>playground and you will see these qualities. I am convinced that these are good things worth keeping.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">leadership in their families. Out of fear of upsetting their partner or appearing too much like their 
<br>controlling, authoritarian, or abusive fathers, Nice Guys frequently fail to be the leader their family 
<br>needs. Consequently, the job of leading the family often falls on their wives. Most of the women I talk to 
<br>don&#x27;t want this job, but end up taking it by default.

<br>unconscious bond is the result of a normal childhood developmental phenomenon gone amuck. Let me 
<br>explain.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:72108px; width:587px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">All little boys naturally fall in love with their mother and desire to have her all to themselves. Healthy 
<br>mothers and fathers help their sons successfully move through this normal developmental stage. As they 
<br>do, the young boy individuates from his mother, bonds with men, and becomes available for an intimate 
<br>relationship with another woman in adulthood.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:72194px; width:581px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Each parent plays a significant role in facilitating this healthy transition. First, the mother must know 
<br>how to give enough to meet the child&#x27;s needs without creating dependency. She must also know how to 
<br>get her own needs met so she is not tempted to use her son to fill the void. Second, the father must be 
<br>present and have a healthy bond with his son. This connection helps the little boy move from the cozy 
<br>lap of his mother to the challenging world of men.

<br>childhood. As a result, many Nice Guys were forced into an unhealthy bond with their mother. This 
<br>bond might have formed if they had to please an angry, critical, or controlling mother. More often than 
<br>not, the bond was the result of being forced to take care of a needy, dependent, or smothering mother.

<br>with a neighbor, call up a friend, or go to a ballgame. Since many Nice Guys are enmeshed with their 
<br>wives, families, or work, this means taking time away from these things.

There is no right way to do this, but it can 
<br>include joining a team, going to sporting events, joining a prayer or discussion group, having a poker 
<br>night, doing volunteer work, going fishing, going for a run, or just hanging out.

<br>men. Alan had a difficult time doing things for himself, especially with other men. When he made a 
<br>conscious effort to begin addressing this issue he had to first take a look at what kept him disconnected 
<br>from men and what he could do to start changing the pattern.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:74398px; width:582px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">One of the first things Alan did was to join a men&#x27;s therapy group. Even then, it took more than a year 
<br>before he began doing things with the men outside of the group. As he did, these men were able to give 
<br>him feedback about his defense mechanisms that kept him isolated. These men also supported him in 
<br>changing the ways he related to his wife.

Later, 
<br>he took the lead in starting up a softball team. At first it was difficult to take time out just for himself, 
<br>especially when it meant being away from his family.

<br>on a regular basis. He even takes a yearly road trip with friends across the country for a weekend of golf. 
<br>He looks at these trips with the guys as one of the highlights of his year.

<br>marriage. Alan had made his wife his emotional center. His life revolved around trying to please her and 
<br>make her happy. Due to his ineffective covert contracts, Alan never believed Marie gave as much to him 
<br>as he gave to her. As a result, he was often resentful and passive-aggressive. When Alan began to get his 
<br>emotional and social needs met with men, it took a lot of pressure off his wife. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:74726px; width:590px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As Alan reclaimed his masculine energy, he also began to look more attractive to Marie. Even though it 
<br>was initially difficult to tell her that he was going to spend time with his friends, she respected him when 
<br>he did. This newfound respect rekindled the feelings she first felt toward Alan early in their relationship.

Perhaps one of the 
<br>most significant benefits for Nice Guys is that it improves their relationships with women. I consistently 
<br>tell Nice Guys, &quot;The best thing you can do for your relationship with your girlfriend or wife is to have 
<br>male friends.&quot; As they get many of their emotional needs met with men, recovering Nice Guys become 
<br>less dependent, needy, manipulative and resentful in their relationships with women.

<br>approval or allowing themselves to be defined by the opposite sex. If the Nice Guy&#x27;s girlfriend or wife is 
<br>angry at him or thinks he is a jerk, he can take comfort in knowing his buddies think he is OK. He is 
<br>therefore less likely to resort to peacekeeping or fixing to try and keep his partner happy.

<br>agenda. A Nice Guy will frequently avoid doing anything that might upset his partner and cause her to 
<br>not want to have sex with him. With men, recovering Nice Guys don&#x27;t feel like they have to please, 
<br>placate, lie, caretake or sacrifice like they believe they have to with women. Not having a sexual agenda 
<br>removes the fear and dysfunctional dances so common for Nice Guys in their relationships with the 
<br>opposite sex.

<br>difference in her boyfriend. On several occasions, he set boundaries with his mother and refused to let 
<br>her hook an emotional hose up to him. Jamie could tell that this was primarily the result of her boyfriend 
<br>having bonded with several guys in boot camp and from embracing his own masculinity.

Because of their conditioning, Nice Guys tend to fear these

In order to do this, 
<br>recovering Nice Guys have to stop putting junk into their bodies and train them to respond to the 
<br>physical demands of being male. This involves eating healthy foods, eliminating drugs and alcohol, 
<br>working out, drinking lots of water, playing, relaxing, and getting enough rest. Whether the Nice Guy 
<br>stays fit by running, swimming, weight training, martial arts, playing basketball, volleyball, or tennis, 
<br>this physical strength translates into self-confidence and power in every other aspect of his life.

<br>surgery he had been putting off for years. Since he wouldn&#x27;t be able to smoke for a few days, he decided 
<br>it was a good time to quit for good. After his surgery, he began going for walks during his lunch hour. 
<br>He started drinking more water and cut back on his coffee and soft drink consumption. He even took a 
<br>week off from work and went fishing with some friends in Alaska.

<br>in childhood. Either their fathers were passive, unavailable, absent, or defined in some negative way. 
<br>Reclaiming their masculinity requires that Nice Guys examine their relationships with their fathers and 
<br>take a look at them through adult eyes.

On one occasion 
<br>in a No More Mr. Nice Guy! group, Matthew stated that he had no intention of attending his father&#x27;s 
<br>funeral if he should die. Months later, after exploring his relationship with his father in group, he 
<br>decided to call and confront his dad when he didn&#x27;t get invited to a family function.

While 
<br>talking with his father, Matthew came to the realization that even though his dad had problems, he 
<br>wasn&#x27;t bad like his mother had made him out to be. From this encounter, Matthew also realized that he 
<br>had created a similar scenario with his wife in which he identified her as the villain and himself as the 
<br>victim. Not only did that phone call to his father begin to change his relationship with his dad, but also 
<br>with his wife.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">own eyes as they really are. It means taking them out of the gutter or off the pedestal. This may require 
<br>that Nice Guys hold them accountable by expressing their feelings to them â including rage and anger. 
<br>This is essential, even if these men are dead. Sometimes this takes place in their fathers&#x27; presence, 
<br>sometimes not. It&#x27;s not so important that the father is available to do this work. What is essential is that

<br>summer before my son Steve entered the fourth grade. When I attended his PTA open house I was jolted 
<br>with a dose of reality. In kindergarten through fifth grade, there was only one male classroom teacher in 
<br>the whole school. That&#x27;s about a 20-to-1 ratio. As the teachers were introduced a grade at a time and then 
<br>stood together on the gym floor, I received a visual picture of the environment in which little boys spend 
<br>the most impressionable years of their lives.

<br>sons and daughter, but to a whole generation of boys and girls. The more time I spend working with 
<br>Nice Guys, the more I realize that this process represents a powerful tool for giving the next generation a 
<br>saner model of what it means to be men and women.

<br>nursery ruled by women (home, preschool, school) and enter the world of adult manhood. Robert Bly 
<br>discusses the importance of these rituals in his book </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">Iron John.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:79553px; width:589px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In &quot;primitive&quot; societies, Bly writes, the boys are pretty much raised by the women until early 
<br>adolescence. When it is time for the boys to leave the sphere of female influence and move into the 
<br>men&#x27;s world, the men of the tribe stage a raid. They put on their war paint, enter the village, and steal the 
<br>boys away. The women, on cue, weep, protest, and do their best to hang onto the boys. After the men 
<br>have taken the boys outside the village for their period of initiation, the women get together and ask, 
<br>&quot;How did I do? Was I believable?&quot; In these cultures, the men and women work together to facilitate this 
<br>process of transition and initiation.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:79689px; width:587px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">These days, boys try to make this transition from a world ruled by women, but they can&#x27;t do it on their 
<br>own. I have a theory that the phase that adolescent boys pass through where they dress sloppily, look 
<br>scraggly, act aggressively, hole up in their room, slouch, play loud music, swear, and spit a lot, are all 
<br>unconsciously aimed at making themselves so repulsive that even their mothers can&#x27;t stand them. This 
<br>helps them break the symbiotic bonds with their moms. Nevertheless, these young men still need help 
<br>from adult males in pulling away from their mothers without feeling guilt and shame and without overly 
<br>self-destructive behaviors.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:79826px; width:580px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I believe recovering Nice Guys can help boys find a saner model of what it means to be male in our 
<br>culture. This is because there are certain things that boys can only learn from men. As Nice Guys 
<br>embrace their masculinity, they can teach their sons what it means to be male. This includes how to 
<br>handle their aggression, how to handle their libido, how to relate to women, how to bond with a man, 
<br>and perhaps most importantly, how to embrace their own masculinity. Men teach these lessons both by 
<br>example and by interaction with young boys.

<br>I&#x27;m around my boys, I get to see unbridled maleness in action. Not only do I get to teach my sons how to 
<br>handle their testosterone-related behaviors such as aggression and sexuality, they also show me how to 
<br>embrace mine.

Fathers need to take their sons hunting and fishing, 
<br>work on cars with them, take them to work, coach their teams, take them to ball games, work out with 
<br>them, take them on business trips, and let them tag along with them when they go out with the guys. All 
<br>of these activities help boys move successfully into the male world.

<br>relatives, scouts, sports teams, school activities, or big brothers.

<br>strong feelings about what was happening to his nephew because the boy was going through some of the 
<br>same rebellion and acting out with alcohol that Trey had experienced at the same age. The group 
<br>encouraged Trey to reach out to his nephew and be a positive male influence.

Sometimes some hidden behavior â 
<br>an affair, surfing for pornography on the Internet, smoking pot â has blown up in their face and created 
<br>a crisis with their wife or girlfriend. More often, their call to a therapist is motivated by some problem or 
<br>dissatisfaction in their most intimate relationship; their partner doesn&#x27;t want to have sex as often as they 
<br>do, she is depressed, angry, unavailable, or unfaithful (or all of the above).

I define </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">intimacy</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> as &quot;knowing the self, being known by another, and 
<br>knowing another.&quot; Intimacy requires two people who are willing to courageously look inward and make 
<br>themselves totally visible to another. Internalized toxic shame makes this kind of exposure feel life-
<br>threatening for Nice Guys.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:83980px; width:590px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Intimacy, by its nature, would require the Nice Guy to look into the abyss of his most inner self and 
<br>allow others to peer into these same places. It would require the Nice Guy to let someone get close 
<br>enough to see into all the nooks and crannies of his soul. This terrifies Nice Guys, because being known 
<br>means being found out. All Nice Guys have worked their entire lives to become what they believe others 
<br>want them to be while trying to hide their perceived flaws. The demands of intimacy represent 
<br>everything Nice Guys fear most.

<br>Nice Guys enter a relationship they begin a balancing act. In relationships, a life-and-death struggle is 
<br>played out to balance their fear of vulnerability with their fear of isolation. Vulnerability means someone 
<br>may get too close to them and see how bad they are. Nice Guys are convinced that when others make 
<br>this discovery, these people will hurt them, shame them, or leave them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:84380px; width:564px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The alternative doesn&#x27;t seem any better. Isolating themselves from others recreates the abandonment 
<br>experiences that were so terrifying in childhood.

He finds it 
<br>in people who are equally wounded and also have difficulty with intimacy. Together they co-create 
<br>relationships that simultaneously frustrate all parties while protecting them from their fear of being 
<br>found out. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:84518px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Even though it may look like many of the problems Nice Guys experience in relationships are caused by 
<br>the baggage their partner brings with them, this is not the case. It is the relationship the Nice Guy and his 
<br>partner co-create that is the problem.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:84588px; width:585px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">It is true that Nice Guys often pick partners who appear to be projects, and indeed, they do at times pick 
<br>some pretty messed up people. The fact that these partners may have challenges â they are single 
<br>moms, they have financial problems, they are angry, addictive, depressed, overweight, non-sexual, or 
<br>unable to be faithful â is precisely the reason Nice Guys invite these people into their lives. As long as 
<br>attention is focused on the flaws of the partner, it is diverted away from the internalized toxic shame of 
<br>the Nice Guy. This balancing act ensures that the Nice Guy&#x27;s closest relationship will most likely be his 
<br>least intimate.

The first is through 
<br>becoming overly involved in an intimate relationship at the expense of one&#x27;s self and other outside 
<br>interests. The second is through being emotionally unavailable to a primary partner while playing the 
<br>Nice Guy role outside of the relationship. I call the first type of Nice Guy an </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">enmesher</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> and the second 
<br>type an </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">avoider</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">.

His world revolves around her. She is 
<br>more important than his work, his buddies, his hobbies. He will do whatever it takes to make her happy. 
<br>He will give her gifts, try to fix her problems, and arrange his schedule to be with her. He will gladly 
<br>sacrifice his wants and needs to win her love. He will even tolerate her bad moods, rage attacks, 
<br>addictions, and emotional or sexual unavailability â all because he &quot;loves her so much.&quot;

They are like little dogs who hover beneath 
<br>the table just in case a scrap happens to fall their way. Enmeshing Nice Guys do this same hovering 
<br>routine around their partner just in case she happens to drop him a scrap of sexual interest, a scrap of her 
<br>time, a scrap of a good mood, or a scrap of her attention. Even though they are settling for the leftovers 
<br>that fall from the table, enmeshing Nice Guys think they are getting something really good.

<br>relationship, but this is an illusion. The Nice Guy&#x27;s pursuing and enmeshing behavior is an attempt to 
<br>hook up an emotional hose to his partner. This hose is used to suck the life out of her and fill an empty 
<br>place inside of him. The Nice Guy&#x27;s partner unconsciously picks up on this agenda and works like hell to 
<br>make sure the Nice Guy can&#x27;t get close enough to hook up the hose. Consequently, the Nice Guy&#x27;s 
<br>partner is often seen as the one preventing the closeness the Nice Guy desires.

<br>hobby, parents, and everything else before his primary relationship.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> He may not seem like a Nice 
<br>Guy to his partner at all because he is often nice to everyone else but her. He may volunteer to work on 
<br>other people&#x27;s cars. He may spend weekends fixing his mother&#x27;s roof. He may work two or three jobs. 
<br>He may coach his children&#x27;s sports teams. Even though he may not follow his partner around and cater to 
<br>her every whim, he still operates from a covert contract that since he is a Nice Guy, his partner should be 
<br>available to him, even if he isn&#x27;t available to her.

<br>act as if she is a certain way, even when she isn&#x27;t. His unconscious dysfunctional needs may literally 
<br>force his partner to respond in an equally dysfunctional way.

As a child, I never knew what kind of mood my father would be in when I came into the 
<br>house. More often than not, it wasn&#x27;t good. I learned to come home prepared for the worst. I later 
<br>recreated the same pattern in my marriage. I projected my father&#x27;s unpredictable moods onto my wife 
<br>and would frequently arrive home prepared for her to be angry. Even if she was in a good mood, my 
<br>defensiveness often triggered some kind of confrontation between us. Thus Elizabeth came to look like 
<br>my angry father and I perpetuated a familiar, though dysfunctional relationship dynamic.

<br>support them in deciding what is right for them and being that with all of their energy for the whole 
<br>world to see. The people who like them just as they are will hang around. The people who don&#x27;t, won&#x27;t. 
<br>This is the only way to have a healthy relationship. No one really wants to believe that they have to be 
<br>false or hide who they really are to get someone to love them or stay with them. Yet, this is a common 
<br>dynamic in the intimate relationships Nice Guys create.

<br>himself and stop pleasing his partner. Throughout his relationship with his wife Susan, George&#x27;s primary 
<br>goal was to make her happy. Over a period of five years George gave up hunting and fishing (two of his 
<br>passions), quit hanging out with his friends, turned the control of his finances over to Susan, and 
<br>supported her in quitting her job because she was unhappy at work. These changes occurred gradually. 
<br>All were an attempt on George&#x27;s part to please Susan. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:88779px; width:577px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Nevertheless, Susan was rarely happy. By the time George joined a No More Mr. Nice Guy! group, he 
<br>felt helpless and resentful and was ready to leave his wife. George saw Susan as the cause of the 
<br>frustration he was feeling. George spent the first few weeks in our group complaining about his wife. 
<br>Eventually, the group members began to confront George on his victim role and challenged him to do 
<br>something different instead of blaming Susan.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:88882px; width:584px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">It took a few more months, but George began to change. The most significant change was a conscious 
<br>decision to quit trying to make Susan happy. He realized that his attempts to please her weren&#x27;t working 
<br>and were causing him to feel resentful.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:88951px; width:583px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">George began by setting aside one weekend a month to go hunting or fishing. When Susan tried several 
<br>different methods to manipulate him or guilt him out of his decision, he held fast. Next, instead of 
<br>handing his paycheck over to Susan to control, he began giving himself an allowance to spend how he 
<br>wanted. This too drew resistance from his wife. Perhaps the most frightening step was when George set 
<br>up a budget and told Susan that if she wanted more control over the income, she would have to go back 
<br>to working full time.

George felt less like a victim and actually started having more 
<br>positive feelings toward Susan. Second, Susan began taking charge of her own life and became less 
<br>dependent on George. After about a year in group, George shared how much more content he was and 
<br>how much his marriage had improved. He gave credit to the group members who supported him in 
<br>finding the courage to start pleasing himself and stop trying to make Susan happy.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:89663px; width:532px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;Of course I do,&quot; she will respond, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be married to someone I can walk all over.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:89699px; width:586px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Then I warn him. &quot;Your wife is telling you the truth. She doesn&#x27;t feel safe knowing she can push you 
<br>around. She wants to know that you will stand up to her. That is how she will feel secure in the 
<br>relationship. But, here&#x27;s the catch. She has to test to see if she can trust you. The first time you set a 
<br>boundary with her she may react intensely. She will push against it. She will tell you that you are wrong 
<br>for setting that boundary. She will do her best to find out if your boundary is for real.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:89802px; width:589px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">When a recovering Nice Guy sets boundaries with his partner, it makes her feel secure. In general, when 
<br>women feel secure, they feel loved. She will also come to know that if her partner will stand up to her, 
<br>he is also likely to stand up for her. Setting boundaries also creates respect. When a Nice Guy fails to set 
<br>boundaries it communicates to his partner that he doesn&#x27;t really honor himself, so why should she?

<br>the </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Second Date Rule.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Using the second date rule, Nice Guys ask themselves, &quot;If this behavior had 
<br>occurred on the second date, would there have been a third?&quot; This question helps them see if they have 
<br>been putting up with something that they shouldn&#x27;t.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:89975px; width:587px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">When trying to decide how to deal with a behavior they have deemed unacceptable, I encourage Nice 
<br>Guys to apply the </span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Healthy Male Rule.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> Following this rule of thumb, they simply ask themselves, &quot;How 
<br>would a healthy male handle this situation?&quot; For some reason, just asking this question connects them 
<br>with their intuitive wisdom and helps them access the power they need to respond appropriately.

<br>confident that at any point, if he begins to feel uncomfortable, he can say &quot;stop,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; or &quot;slow down,&quot; 
<br>or can remove himself. He can do whatever he needs to do to take care of himself.

When Nice Guys enter a relationship, they frequently 
<br>choose partners who look more dysfunctional than they do. This creates a dangerous illusion that one of 
<br>them is sicker than the other. This is a distortion, because healthy people are not attracted to unhealthy 
<br>people â and vice versa. I frequently tell couples that if you have one obviously wounded person in a 
<br>relationship, you always have two. No exception.

<br>broken one while I was designated the healthy one. These scripts worked well for both of us until she 
<br>started going to counseling. One day, she came home from a therapy session and announced that she had 
<br>discovered that I was just as messed up as she was. Because I couldn&#x27;t entertain the idea that I was 
<br>&quot;messed up,&quot; I responded, &quot;No, you are really finding out that you are just as healthy as I am.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:91123px; width:575px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">The relationship system we had created together allowed both of us to play familiar, yet dysfunctional 
<br>roles. Unfortunately, it also prevented any kind of real intimacy until Elizabeth began to challenge the 
<br>status quo. I&#x27;ve listened to countless Nice Guys who have formed relationships like the one Elizabeth 
<br>and I initially created. These men have the belief that they are victims to their &quot;sick&quot; partner&#x27;s 
<br>dysfunction. This illusion keeps everyone involved stuck in repetitive, ineffective patterns.

<br>partner to get in touch with their childhood experiences of abandonment, neglect, abuse, and smothering. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">They can use this information to better understand why they have created the kind of relationship system 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">they have. This process enables them to make changes that allow them to get what they want in their 
<br>intimate relationships.

<br>significant other as a partner in healing. This not only shifts how he views his partner, but also allows 
<br>him to address childhood issues that prevent him from having a truly intimate relationship.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:91577px; width:589px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In the beginning of this chapter, we met Karl â whose wife Danita seemed as hard to please as his cold, 
<br>critical mother. Karl never knew when his mom might get angry, criticize, or shame him. In adulthood, 
<br>Karl co-created a similar dynamic with Danita. When she got angry, Karl would use all of his childhood 
<br>survival mechanisms, like avoidance and withdrawal, to try to cope. Karl would accuse Danita of &quot;being 
<br>angry all the time&quot; and would walk on eggshells to avoid upsetting her. Karl would tell himself, &quot;I don&#x27;t 
<br>deserve this.&quot; He would then retreat and create escape scenarios in his head.

<br>help him clean out his old issues around his fear of angry and critical people. As Karl made this shift

<br>standing up to Danita rather than avoiding and withdrawing. As he came to see Danita&#x27;s anger as a result 
<br>of her own childhood wounding, Danita began to look less and less angry to him. As his view of his wife 
<br>began to shift, Karl began to feel more loving toward Danita and their relationship began to show 
<br>marked improvement.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:92287px; width:590px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">A couple of years ago we bought a Weimaraner puppy. We decided that if we were going to have a big 
<br>dog in the house, we should take him to obedience school. One of the first lessons we learned was that 
<br>we were the ones who needed obedience training. Most dogs that behave badly, we found out, have been 
<br>conditioned to do so by ignorant or inconsistent owners.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:92373px; width:570px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In many ways, humans aren&#x27;t much different from pets. People often behave the way they have been 
<br>trained to behave. For example, if a person gives his dog a treat when he pisses on the carpet, the dog 
<br>will keep pissing on the carpet. The same is true for humans. If the Nice Guy reinforces his partner&#x27;s 
<br>undesirable behaviors, she will keep behaving in undesirable ways.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:92459px; width:591px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Here is the irony for Nice Guys: Nice Guys like the idea of a smooth and problem-free relationship. 
<br>Typically, if their partner is unhappy, depressed, angry, or having a problem, they will jump right in and 
<br>try and fix it or make it better. They believe that by doing so, they will make the problem go away and 
<br>everything will quickly get back to normal. Unfortunately, this is like giving a dog a treat for pissing on 
<br>the carpet. Every time a Nice Guy responds to or pays attention to a behavior he would like to eliminate, 
<br>he is actually reinforcing that very behavior. This reinforcement increases the likelihood that that 
<br>behavior will occur again. For example, Joe&#x27;s wife frequently came home from work in a silent rage over

<br>attempt to relieve his anxiety, he would ask his wife what was wrong. After a little coaxing, she would 
<br>spend the next couple of hours venting to Joe about how mistreated she was at work. Joe would listen 
<br>and offer helpful suggestions, hoping that by doing so, she would get over her mood.

Every 
<br>time he asked his wife what was wrong, listened for hours, and offered advice, he was actually 
<br>reinforcing a behavior pattern he found undesirable.

He was oblivious to the fact that he 
<br>was responsible for perpetuating a behavior he found undesirable. When the men in his No More Mr. 
<br>Nice Guy! group pointed this fact out to him, he decided to try something different.

He ate dinner in 
<br>silence and then went out to the garage. Even though he felt intense anxiety, he resisted his impulses to 
<br>try to &quot;fix&quot; his wife. As he lay awake in bed that night, the deafening silence kept him awake for hours. 
<br>The next morning, the silence continued. Joe was afraid this behavior might go on forever. In an attempt 
<br>to relieve his anxiety, he tried making a little small talk. His wife responded with one-word answers and 
<br>left for work.

Joe&#x27;s wife came home from work in a good mood 
<br>and asked Joe if he wanted to go for a walk. While walking she told him how she had resolved the 
<br>previous day&#x27;s problem. Joe revealed to his wife how uncomfortable it had made him to not try to fix her 
<br>problem the previous evening. She responded by telling Joe that she didn&#x27;t want him to try to fix her 
<br>problems and that she liked it better that he had given her some space to work it out on her own.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:93260px; width:587px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">For Nice Guys who see a relationship come to an end, or for the ones who are presently single, I 
<br>encourage them to take a different approach when beginning new relationships. Relationships are messy 
<br>and there is no way to eliminate the bumps and potholes, but we don&#x27;t have to make them any more 
<br>difficult than they already are. This is one area where I strongly encourage Nice Guys to </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">do something 
<br>different.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> That is, enter relationships with a healthy agenda, rather than an unconscious, dysfunctional 
<br>one.

<br>challenge when it comes to restoring a car, but it&#x27;s a terrible way to choose a partner. Nice Guys have a

<br>Because they don&#x27;t know why a healthy or independent person would want them, they settle for a 
<br>diamond in the rough. They tend to pick partners who have had troubled childhoods, are sexual abuse 
<br>survivors, have had a string of bad relationships, are depressed, are having money problems, are 
<br>overweight, or are struggling single moms. Then they go to work operating from a covert contract â 
<br>fixing, caretaking, and pleasing â all with the hope that she will turn out to be a polished gem. 
<br>Unfortunately, this strategy rarely works.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:93675px; width:580px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">When recovering Nice Guys create relationships with people who don&#x27;t need fixing, they improve their 
<br>odds of finding the love they want. This doesn&#x27;t mean searching for the </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">perfect</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> partner, just one who is 
<br>already taking responsibility for her own life. Over time, the members of my No More Mr. Nice Guy! 
<br>groups have come up with a number of traits to </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">consciously</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> look for when creating new relationships. 
<br>These traits include (in no particular order):

<br>well by this list (especially if it is the Nice Guy doing the evaluating). That doesn&#x27;t mean they need to 
<br>jump out of the relationship and go looking for greener pastures. Instead, I encourage these men to first 
<br>begin addressing their own behaviors and look at why they needed to create the kind of relationship they 
<br>have with their present partner.

I 
<br>have found that when recovering Nice Guys begin dealing with their own dysfunctional patterns, their 
<br>relationships also begin changing. At times these changes cause them to reevaluate their desire to get 
<br>out. Sometimes they confirm it is time for a change.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:94104px; width:568px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Nice Guys have a strong tendency to try to do everything &quot;right.&quot; This list isn&#x27;t meant as a magic 
<br>formula. There are no perfect people and no perfect relationships. But by consciously looking for the 
<br>traits listed above in a prospective partner, Nice Guys can save themselves a lot of grief and improve 
<br>their chances of actually finding what they are looking for.

<br>must give themselves a chance to accurately evaluate the traits listed above by staying out of bed with a 
<br>person until they really get to know her. Once the sex begins in relationships, the learning stops. Sex 
<br>creates such a powerful bond that it is difficult to accurately evaluate the appropriateness of a new

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">survival mechanisms are focused and magnified. I believe it is safe to say that every Nice Guy with 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">whom I have ever worked has had some significant problem with sex. These problems are manifested in 
<br>many ways, but the most common are:

The focus 
<br>of this problem is frequently directed at a seemingly sexually inhibited or unavailable partner (or 
<br>the unavailability of women in general).

<br>much sex and/or don&#x27;t have very much good sex. Even though most Nice Guys have a tendency to focus 
<br>on factors outside of themselves as the cause of this problem, the opposite is closer to the truth. It is Nice 
<br>Guys themselves who are masters at making sure that their sex lives are less than satisfying.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">Vagiphobia</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> to describe this propensity. Vagiphobia is a syndrome where the penis tries to stay out of 
<br>vaginas or gets out quickly once it is in. While this survival mechanism may help protect the Nice Guy 
<br>from having to experience his shame and fear, it also guarantees he won&#x27;t have very much sex.

Alan began therapy due to a problematic habit of entering 
<br>into sexualized relationships outside of his marriage. Some of these trysts became overtly sexual, yet 
<br>none were ever consummated with intercourse. The problem came to a head after he began a

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:97784px; width:590px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In therapy, Alan revealed that he liked the attention of women. In social situations he always felt more 
<br>comfortable connecting with women. Over time, it became apparent that due to childhood conditioning 
<br>â a monogamous bond with his mother, the decision to be different from his father, and the effects of 
<br>fundamentalist religious teachings â Alan found creative ways to get the attention of women while 
<br>avoiding putting his penis in their vaginas. (I refer to this common Nice Guy behavior as &quot;flirting 
<br>without fucking.&quot; As long as the Nice Guy doesn&#x27;t put his penis in a vagina, he can exchange all kinds of 
<br>sexual energy yet convince himself he hasn&#x27;t really had sex or hasn&#x27;t done anything wrong.)
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:97921px; width:589px; height:131px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">On one occasion, Alan shared an example with his No More Mr. Nice Guy! group of this behavior. Alan 
<br>had been on a business trip, traveling with a co-worker, a young woman whom Alan found very 
<br>attractive. During the trip, they flirted and exchanged sexual innuendoes. One evening, they sat in the 
<br>bar and talked about their lives. The evening ended with some slow dancing. The next evening after 
<br>drinks, the woman invited Alan to join her in the hot tub. She showed up in a revealing string bikini. 
<br>While in the hot tub, she sat on Alan&#x27;s lap and they kissed passionately. Even though he was very 
<br>aroused, he turned down her offer to go up to her room because he didn&#x27;t want to &quot;jeopardize their 
<br>working relationship.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:98074px; width:589px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">This story is consistent with Alan&#x27;s lifelong avoidance of vaginas. Alan had a couple of girlfriends in 
<br>high school. But whenever the girls got serious and wanted to move beyond petting, Alan felt smothered 
<br>and broke up.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:98144px; width:587px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Alan portrayed his wife as being sexually withdrawn. One factor that contributed to this situation was 
<br>that Alan would never directly initiate sex. He believed women thought sex was bad and he was 
<br>convinced that if he was too direct in letting them know he wanted to have sex, they would think </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">he</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> was 
<br>bad.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:98230px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Alan used his frustration over his wife&#x27;s sexual unavailability to justify his sexualized behavior with 
<br>other women. Interestingly enough, Alan had a consistent knack of only flirting with women that weren&#x27;t 
<br>very likely to be available to consummate a relationship with him. On the rare occasion that he guessed 
<br>wrong, Alan would find some good reason to not follow through with what he had started.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:98363px; width:580px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">It is not unusual for Nice Guys to pride themselves on being good lovers. Being a good lover can be an 
<br>attachment these men use to feel valuable. It can be a way to convince themselves they are different 
<br>from other men. It can also be a very effective mechanism for allowing them to have sex while staying 
<br>distracted from their internalized shame and fear. As long as they are focused on the arousal and 
<br>pleasure of their partner, Nice Guys can distract themselves from their own toxic shame, feelings of 
<br>inadequacy, or fear of being smothered. Terrance, a Nice Guy in his mid-thirties is a good example.

<br>therapy session. &quot;My first wife left me for another man,&quot; he continued without pausing. &quot;That was 
<br>devastating. The good news is, I met a wonderful, sensual, sexual woman, and we&#x27;re engaged to get 
<br>married. There&#x27;s only one problem. I come too fast. She turns me on so much, I just get too excited.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:98681px; width:587px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Terrance went on to describe how hard he worked to please his girlfriend when they made love. 
<br>Whenever they had sex, Terrance would try to make sure his girlfriend had two or three orgasms by 
<br>stimulating her orally before he put his penis inside her vagina. He then tried to bring her to one more 
<br>climax vaginally. Unfortunately, he frequently ejaculated before she had her final orgasm. Terrance was 
<br>so seemingly selfless that he told his fiancÃ©e that he didn&#x27;t care if he never had an orgasm, as long as she 
<br>was satisfied.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:98800px; width:585px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">&quot;Everything is great except this one issue,&quot; Terrance claimed. &quot;Her kids love me. Her parents love me. 
<br>She says she loves everything about me, except she feels like 30 percent is missing. She doesn&#x27;t seem to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">want to make love anymore and is talking about postponing the wedding until I can get this thing fixed.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:98870px; width:589px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Most of the time, Nice Guys like Terrance are totally unaware of how much they are missing by trying 
<br>to be great lovers. When Nice Guys set out to be great lovers, they are actually creating a recipe for 
<br>boring sex. Sex that focuses on trying to please the other guarantees a routine, do-what-worked-last-time 
<br>kind of experience. Trying to be a great lover pretty much insures that a Nice Guy will not have many 
<br>passionate, reciprocal, spontaneous, serendipitous, or intimate sexual experiences â hardly a recipe for 
<br>good sex!

<br>Want
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:99053px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Imagine the financial jackpot of inventing a pill to take away loneliness, cure boredom, alleviate feelings 
<br>of worthlessness, smooth over conflict, create feelings of being loved, relieve stress, and generally solve 
<br>all personal problems. Nice Guys believe such a drug exists â they call it sex.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:99122px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Many Nice Guys discovered at an early age that sexual arousal was a good distraction from the isolation, 
<br>turmoil, unrealistic demands, and abandonment experiences of their childhood. Unfortunately, when 
<br>Nice Guys bring their sensual security blanket into adulthood, it prevents them from experiencing 
<br>intimate and fulfilling sex with another individual.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:99208px; width:585px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I have found Nice Guys to be prone to hidden, compulsive sexual behavior. I have developed a theory 
<br>that states, </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">the nicer the guy, the darker the sexual secrets.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> I find this to be consistently true. Sex is a 
<br>basic human drive. Because most Nice Guys believe they are bad for being sexual, or believe that other 
<br>people will think they are bad, sexual impulses have to be kept hidden from view. The Nice Guy&#x27;s 
<br>sexuality doesn&#x27;t go away, it just goes underground. Therefore, the more dependent a man is on external 
<br>approval, the deeper he is going to have to hide his sexual behavior.

<br>Everybody liked Lyle. He was one of those guys who didn&#x27;t seem to have any rough edges. A devout 
<br>Christian, Lyle taught Sunday school and was always willing to help anyone in need.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:99510px; width:577px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Lyle&#x27;s life seemed perfect. There was only one hitch â he was secretly addicted to pornography. 
<br>Growing up in an Evangelical Christian home, he first discovered this drug when he was nine. A loner 
<br>as a child, Lyle would spend hours in his tree fort looking at pictures of naked women. With his 
<br>pornography, he never felt alone.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:99596px; width:584px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Fifteen years into his marriage, Lyle&#x27;s habit remained a well-kept secret. Over the years his compulsive 
<br>behavior expanded to renting adult videos, visiting peep shows and strip bars, and calling 900 numbers. 
<br>Most recently, his obsession had found flight in cyberspace. Frequenting sex chat rooms he carried on a 
<br>number of sexual relationships with faceless surfers on the Internet.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:99682px; width:574px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Periodically during their marriage, Lyle&#x27;s wife would confront him over their lackluster sex life. She 
<br>would protest that it just wasn&#x27;t normal to go months without having sex. Lyle would validate her 
<br>feelings and assert that he too would like more sex. He would then fall back on the excuse that he was 
<br>usually too tired from work and too stressed with the demands of family life.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:99768px; width:585px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Many times throughout his life, Lyle promised himself he would quit visiting his secret sexual world. 
<br>Time and time again he would throw out his stash of magazines or swear off the videos and chat rooms. 
<br>He would breathe a sigh of relief, only to find himself back at it again weeks or months later.

<br>behavior that there was little left for a real, person-to-person sexual relationship.

<br>opposite sex. If he is to have any hope of securing a girlfriend and someday having sex, he must figure 
<br>out what it takes to get a female to notice him and approve of him. For some boys this process seems to 
<br>come fairly easily. If they happen to be good-looking, a star athlete, or from an affluent family, 
<br>attracting females may not be overly difficult for them.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100040px; width:591px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Once you exclude the minority of adolescent males listed above, that leaves the majority of teenage boys 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:13px">who have no clue of what it will take to get a girl to like them. It is at this point that many young men 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">decide that maybe by being &quot;nice,&quot; they will stand out from the other guys and might gain the approval 
<br>of some member of the opposite sex. This decision is especially important if the young man has already 
<br>been conditioned to believe that he is not OK just as he is.

<br>woman would be lucky to have them while simultaneously wondering why any woman would want 
<br>them. Because they can&#x27;t think of any other reason why a woman would be attracted to them or want to 
<br>have sex with them, Nice Guys hang on to their strategy of &quot;being nice&quot; even when it consistently 
<br>proves ineffective in getting them the sex they want.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100378px; width:588px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Ironically, trying to be nice robs a man of his life energy. The more a Nice Guy seeks approval and tries 
<br>to &quot;do it right,&quot; the tighter he clamps a lid down on any kind of energy that might actually draw a person 
<br>to him. This is why I frequently hear Nice Guys lament about women not being attracted to them. The 
<br>problem is, once they have repressed all of their life energy, there is little about them to get anyone&#x27;s 
<br>attention or turn them on.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100481px; width:581px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Women consistently tell me that even though they may be initially drawn to a Nice Guy&#x27;s pleasing 
<br>demeanor, over time they find it difficult to get excited about having sex with him. Often the partner 
<br>feels defective, but it is really not her fault. There is just very little about the Nice Guy persona to flip a 
<br>switch or arouse a prospective partner. Once again, by doing the opposite of what works, Nice Guys 
<br>prevent themselves from getting the sex they want.

<br>When she would say &quot;no&quot; he would pout and withdraw. When she did consent to being sexual he would 
<br>focus on her arousal while she did little to reciprocate. With pithy awareness she revealed, &quot;I could tell 
<br>him it would really turn me on if he set himself on fire. He would gladly do it and think he was getting 
<br>good sex because it made me happy.&quot;

Aaron 
<br>provides a good example of a pretty common way Nice Guys create bad sex. Let&#x27;s visit his bedroom and 
<br>observe a typical sexual scenario between him and his wife Hannah.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100802px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Aaron and Hannah haven&#x27;t had sex in several weeks, a common occurrence in their relationship. 
<br>Tonight, Aaron is feeling sexual, but instead of telling Hannah that he wants to make love, he goes into a 
<br>pattern of indirectly trying to arouse her. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:100872px; width:581px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Even though Hannah has let Aaron know on several occasions she resents his &quot;pestering,&quot; he moves up 
<br>behind her in bed and begins to rub her back. As he massages her shoulders he momentarily tunes out 
<br>his resentment over her sexual unavailability. As he slowly moves his hands down to rub her buttocks, 
<br>he also tunes out that her body is totally unreceptive to his touch. He hopes that by moving slowly and 
<br>not alarming her by being too overtly sexual, she will get in the mood. This approach has occasionally 
<br>worked in the past.

<br>his own body. By now, he is focused on Hannah&#x27;s arousal and trying to anticipate how to stimulate her 
<br>just enough to get her in the mood without doing too much to make her angry.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:101186px; width:590px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Finally, because she hasn&#x27;t rebuffed his advances, he rolls her over and for the next twenty minutes 
<br>focuses all of his attention on her arousal until she has an orgasm. Since he is disconnected from his own 
<br>physical arousal, he has a difficult time climaxing himself. To help himself along, he fantasizes about 
<br>the young secretary at work. When he finally has an orgasm, he immediately shifts his focus back to his 
<br>wife to check in on her emotional state. Later, as he rolls over and goes to sleep, Aaron feels empty and 
<br>resentful.

<br>sexual shame and fear out of the closet. Lyle was a good Christian, husband, and father who struggled 
<br>with compulsive sexual behavior. Everything came crashing down for Lyle when his wife found a phone 
<br>bill and called some of the strange numbers. She was bewildered and devastated. Never in her wildest 
<br>dreams (or nightmares) did she think that Lyle might be involved in anything like pornography or phone 
<br>sex. Little did she know she had just discovered the tip of the iceberg. Confronted with the evidence, 
<br>Lyle initially feigned surprise and denied any knowledge of its origin. Finally, he broke down and told 
<br>all. Well, almost all. It took several more weeks, several more emotional confrontations, and a call to me 
<br>before everything came out.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:103053px; width:591px; height:114px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">After a couple of sessions of individual therapy, I suggested that Lyle start attending a 12-step group for 
<br>sexual addicts. This idea initially terrified Lyle, but he knew he would have to do something radically 
<br>different if he wanted to free himself of his compulsion and experience true sexual intimacy. To his 
<br>surprise, revealing his long-kept secrets in the presence of other recovering sex addicts wasn&#x27;t as difficult 
<br>as he feared. In time, he began to look forward to the opportunity to talk about himself with safe people. 
<br>Every time he revealed some secret thought or act, he felt a sense of relief, as if a weight had been lifted 
<br>from his shoulders.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:103190px; width:584px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As Lyle revealed his fear and shame to safe people, he found that he was less interested in his hidden, 
<br>compulsive behaviors. As he and his wife became more open and intimate with each other, he also 
<br>began to enjoy a physical closeness with her that he had once tried to avoid. When Lyle came out of the 
<br>closet, he began to heal a lifetime of hidden sexual behavior.

<br>of the closet. I support them in talking explicitly about their sexuality. In our culture, most sex talk is 
<br>done in pornographic, demeaning, moralizing, shaming, clinical, or joking ways. I invite recovering 
<br>Nice Guys to reveal the ways they act out. I have them talk about their sexual history and early sexual 
<br>experiences. I ask them to bring samples of pornography they find arousing. This is another way of 
<br>releasing shame while also gaining important information.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:103396px; width:585px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Throughout the entire process of revealing themselves, I encourage recovering Nice Guys to experience 
<br>whatever they may be feeling â shame, guilt, fear, arousal. At the same time, I give them supportive 
<br>messages that what they are feeling is OK. There are so many negative messages in our society about 
<br>male sexuality, it is difficult for Nice Guys to overcome their conditioning without this kind of 
<br>encouragement and support.

<br>especially true with sex. When recovering Nice Guys decide to take responsibility for their own needs 
<br>and take matters into their own hands, they put themselves in a position to get the quantity and quality of 
<br>sex they want. Let me explain.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:104060px; width:588px; height:98px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">All significant behavior patterns are the sum of many, much smaller behavior patterns. The most 
<br>effective way to change a behavior is to change its smallest elements. For example, if a Nice Guys is not 
<br>getting as much sex as he wants or isn&#x27;t getting the kind of sex he wants, the only way to change this 
<br>behavior pattern is to change its smallest components. Rather than going out and trying to have more 
<br>sex, it is more effective to change the little things that create the overall pattern of not getting much sex. 
<br>Change the little things, and the big picture changes as a result.

<br>they must learn how to have the same with themselves. By taking matters into their own hands â by 
<br>practicing </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">healthy masturbation</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> â recovering Nice Guys can change the most basic dynamics that

Healthy 
<br>masturbation is a process of letting sexual energy unfold. It has no goal or destination. It&#x27;s not just about 
<br>orgasms. It does not require outside stimulation from pornography and doesn&#x27;t use trances or fantasy to 
<br>stay distracted from shame and fear. It is about learning to pay attention to what feels good. Most of all, 
<br>it is about accepting sole responsibility for one&#x27;s sexual pleasure and expression.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:104707px; width:583px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Many Nice Guys are initially uncomfortable with the discussion of healthy masturbation. The concept 
<br>seems like an oxymoron. In general, Nice Guys have tremendous internalized shame around 
<br>masturbation. They also frequently surround themselves with people who reinforce this shame (partner, 
<br>religion, etc.). Many Nice Guys also struggle with compulsive masturbation. They fear that attempting 
<br>any kind of self-gratification might open up Pandora&#x27;s Box.

<br>using fantasy or pornography there is no way for their behavior to become compulsive. I have also found 
<br>that when they share the experience with other non-judgmental men, their shame diminishes rapidly.

When a

<br>sex therapists advocate fantasy as a way of improving a sex life, it is actually the best way I know 
<br>to kill it. Fantasizing during sex makes about as much sense as thinking about a Big Mac while 
<br>eating a gourmet meal. About the only thing fantasy accomplishes is to distract a person from his

<br>break up with him. In the first several sessions, I focused on the subject of him making his needs a 
<br>priority. As with most Nice Guys, this initially made him uncomfortable (to put it mildly). Terrance was 
<br>terrified that if he wasn&#x27;t a great lover and didn&#x27;t keep his girlfriend happy, she would leave him like his 
<br>ex-wife did.

<br>regularly that this would make him more attractive to his fiancÃ©e, not less. As he began to discover that 
<br>making his needs a priority didn&#x27;t drive his girlfriend away, we took it to the next step. I talked with 
<br>Terrance about healthy masturbation. I encouraged him to find a time when he would be undisturbed in 
<br>which he could focus on his own pleasure and arousal. I suggested that he do this without having a goal 
<br>of climaxing and without using fantasy or pornography. I encouraged him to pay attention to what felt 
<br>good to him and to observe the ways he unconsciously tried to distract himself from his shame and fear.

The first time he tried it he reported not 
<br>feeling &quot;much of anything.&quot; I encouraged him to continue the assignment at least once a week. After a 
<br>few weeks he reported that he was actually beginning to enjoy pleasuring himself but felt some shame

We talked 
<br>about Terrance taking his focus off her arousal and orgasms and beginning to focus more on himself. 
<br>His girlfriend actually expressed relief. She revealed that it felt like a burden when Terrance expected 
<br>her to have multiple orgasms. Instead of telling him this in the past, she had just faked it.

They actually 
<br>began spending more time talking with each other about what they liked and didn&#x27;t like while they were 
<br>having sex. Even though it was initially difficult, Terrance shared with his fiancÃ©e what he had found out 
<br>about himself from his own healthy masturbation. He was surprised when she expressed interest in 
<br>pleasuring him and having a reciprocal sexual relationship with him.

It has no goal. It 
<br>is free of agendas and expectations. Rather than being a performance, it is an unfolding of sexual energy. 
<br>It is about two people revealing themselves in the most intimate and vulnerable of ways. Good sex 
<br>occurs when two people focus on their own pleasure, passion, and arousal, and stay connected to those 
<br>same things in their partner. All of these dynamics allow good sex to unfold in unpredictable, 
<br>spontaneous, and memorable ways.

<br>sex. For the first few weeks in the No More Mr. Nice Guy! group, Aaron vented his frustrations and 
<br>shared how helpless he felt to get Hannah to want to have sex with him. It was obvious that Aaron 
<br>believed his wife held the key to his sexual happiness and that he was angry over her willful refusal to 
<br>use that key. As a result, he felt &quot;rejected&quot; and &quot;worthless.&quot;

<br>sex with Hannah for a period of six months. During this time I suggested that he focus on doing things 
<br>he had given up when he and Hannah got married. I also encouraged him to tell Hannah whatever he 
<br>was feeling. I shared with him that a sexual moratorium would make it easier for him to do these things 
<br>because he wouldn&#x27;t be so concerned about maintaining the possibility of her availability. If they weren&#x27;t 
<br>having sex, he wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about doing something that might make her angry and cause her 
<br>to withhold sex.

<br>I told him the goal was not to get her to have more sex, but for him to reclaim his key and stop feeling 
<br>like a victim.

<br>reported doing things for himself that previously would have created tremendous anxiety. He went out 
<br>with some guy friends he hadn&#x27;t seen in a couple of years. He began to share his feelings with his wife. 
<br>On more than one occasion, this included telling her when he was angry at her. He even let her know on 
<br>a couple of occasions when he wasn&#x27;t in the mood to listen to her talk about her problems. He also found 
<br>that he became more honest â revealing things to her that he had previously kept to himself.

<br>since he was not pursuing her, she felt freer to move toward him. She also expressed that she liked being 
<br>able to have sexual energy with Aaron, without it always having to end up in intercourse.

<br>like them. They are just themselves: fierce, strong, competitive, and sexually proud. Because they are 
<br>what they are and do what they do, prospective mates are attracted.

As recovering Nice Guys become comfortable 
<br>just being themselves, they begin to look more attractive. Self-respect, courage, and integrity look good 
<br>on a man. As recovering Nice Guys chart their own path and put themselves first, people respond.

<br>when a seemingly unavailable partner expresses a desire to be sexual. One client, who hadn&#x27;t had sex 
<br>with his wife in 14 months, shared in a Nice Guy group that he was tired of listening to his wife 
<br>complain about her work problems. That night, for the first time in 15 years of marriage, he told his wife 
<br>that he was too tired to listen. Even though she was initially angry, later that night she asked him if he 
<br>wanted to make love.

Sex is powerful, 
<br>chaotic, and wild. It crackles with cosmic energy. It draws us like a moth to a flame. As recovering Nice 
<br>Guys release their sexual shame and fear, take responsibility for their own pleasure, refuse to settle for 
<br>bad sex, and practice being just who they are, they put themselves in the position to embrace this cosmic 
<br>force without fear or reservation. This is when the sex really gets good.

Some were neglected, 
<br>some were used, some were abused, some were abandoned. All grew up believing that it was a bad or

<br>Nobody can be good at everything or succeed all on their own. Nice Guys believe they should be able to. 
<br>They might be jacks-of-all-trades, but they are typically masters of none. This childhood conditioning

<br>people won&#x27;t expect too much of them.

<br>distorted view of themselves. With a naive, immature logic they came to the conclusion that if their 
<br>needs were not important, neither were they. This is the basis of their toxic shame. At their core, all Nice 
<br>Guys believe they are not important or good enough.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:113245px; width:581px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">If a Nice Guy was called on to take care of a critical, needy, or dependent parent, he received a double 
<br>dose of toxic shame. A child believes he should be able to please a critical parent, fix the problems of a 
<br>depressed parent, and meet the needs of a smothering parent. Unfortunately, he can&#x27;t.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:113315px; width:583px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Bold; font-size:14px">As a result of their inability to fix, please, or take care of one or more parents, many Nice Guys 
<br>developed a deep-seated sense of inadequacy.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> They believed they </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">should</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> be able to do the job. 
<br>Nevertheless, they never could seem to do it right or good enough â mom was still depressed, dad was 
<br>still critical.

Some Nice Guys 
<br>compensate by trying to do everything right. They hope that by doing so, no one will ever find out how 
<br>inadequate they are. Other Nice Guys just give up before they try.

<br>trying something new. It keeps them in the same old rut, never seeing how talented and intelligent they 
<br>really are. Everyone around them can see these things, but their distorted childhood lenses won&#x27;t let them

It causes 
<br>them to believe they better hang on to what they&#x27;ve got and not take too many chances. It leads them to 
<br>resent other people who seem to have what they lack.

They don&#x27;t believe they deserve to have 
<br>good things. They find all kinds of ways to make sure their view of the world is never challenged. They 
<br>settle for scraps and think it is all they deserve. They create all kinds of rationalizations to explain why 
<br>they will never have what they really desire. Because of their self-fulfilling beliefs, Nice Guys rarely 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">live up to their potential or get what they really want in life.

<br>love. The first is that they tend to recreate familiar, yet dissatisfying relationships. They find partners 
<br>who will help them create the same dysfunctional kinds of relationships they experienced as children. 
<br>These men then frequently see themselves as being victims to the dysfunction of their partners. Nice 
<br>Guys have a difficult time seeing that they were attracted to these people for a reason.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:114192px; width:572px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Second, Nice Guys rarely experience the kind of relationships they want because they are bad enders. 
<br>When a healthy person would pack up and move on, Nice Guys just keep doing more of the same, 
<br>hoping that something will miraculously change.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:114262px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Nice Guys aren&#x27;t much different in their jobs. They are attracted to careers and work situations that allow 
<br>them to recreate the dysfunctional roles, relationships, and rules of their childhood. They often see 
<br>themselves as helpless victims to these situations. Rarely do they see why they need these systems to be 
<br>the way they are and that they have the choice to leave.

<br>really want or rise to the top of their chosen vocation.

<br>leave the group a millionaire. This statement really has very little to do with money or material wealth 
<br>â it is about discovering passion and living up to potential.

As these men work on 
<br>recovering from the Nice Guy Syndrome, they begin to accept themselves just as they are. This 
<br>acceptance of the self allows them to embrace their passions and face their fears.

<br>begin flowing freely into their lives. Sometimes this takes the form of money. Sometimes it takes the 
<br>form of love. Sometimes it takes the form of sex. Sometimes it takes the form of the bright lights of 
<br>fame. Sometimes it includes all of the above.

When I first met 
<br>Charlie he was stuck in a job he hated and living a life characterized by mediocrity and fear. Charlie had 
<br>completed his engineering degree a couple of years before, yet he was still working at the same job he 
<br>had held before starting college. Charlie&#x27;s employers had promised him a big promotion upon 
<br>graduation. When they failed to keep their promise, Charlie just stifled his resentment and kept on doing 
<br>the same old thing he had always done.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:115049px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Charlie&#x27;s single passion was flying. In spite of warnings of disaster from his mother, he had begun taking 
<br>flying lessons after he finished college. Though Charlie dreamed of earning his pilot&#x27;s license, he never 
<br>seemed to be able to complete the necessary requirements to achieve his goal.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:115119px; width:584px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">A woman at his work introduced Charlie to my website. When he read the description of a Nice Guy he 
<br>was mortified. He couldn&#x27;t figure out how someone could know him so well. It took him six months 
<br>before he worked up the nerve to send me an email. It took him another two months to send me a 
<br>second. From the first time Charlie looked at my website he knew he needed to join a men&#x27;s group, but 
<br>the idea of being that vulnerable terrified him.

Charlie decided that if something 
<br>frightened him that much, he needed to face his fear and do it. Little did he know then, but that decision 
<br>was just the beginning of a journey that would lead Charlie toward the rediscovery of his passion and 
<br>purpose in life.

<br>that fear. Charlie&#x27;s progress was slow but steady. Basically, he crawled until he could walk. He took 
<br>baby steps until he could run. Once he got going, there was no stopping him.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">probably four times its present length. I believed I had to be an eloquent writer. I believed the text had to 
<br>be flawless.

<br>men live better lives. Once I let go of the burden of having to get published, be a best-selling author, and 
<br>appear on Oprah, everything changed. I went back to my original agenda. From then on when I wrote, I 
<br>only asked myself one thing: &quot;Will this help my clients find answers to their problems?&quot; I also kept 
<br>reminding myself that my clients would never get a chance to benefit from my insight if I never finished 
<br>the book.

I 
<br>completed the book. Clients reported that it was changing their lives. Therapists began to request copies

<br>everything themselves. Phil is a good example.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120042px; width:584px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Phil&#x27;s goal in life was to be rich. He seemed to have a lot of things going for him: He was good looking, 
<br>intelligent, outgoing, and funny. Yet Phil always seemed to fall way short of achieving his lofty goals 
<br>and dreams. A number of things got in the way â taking shortcuts, procrastination, and insecurities 
<br>about whether he deserved to get what he really wanted.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120128px; width:578px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Perhaps Phil&#x27;s greatest roadblock was his difficulty asking people for help. Phil had a number of faulty 
<br>core beliefs about people helping him. He didn&#x27;t believe he deserved to get what he wanted. He didn&#x27;t 
<br>believe his needs were important to other people. He believed the surest way </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">not</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> to get his needs met 
<br>was to ask in clear and direct ways.

<br>relationship with his wife. I asked Phil if he asked his wife to have sex with him. He said &quot;no.&quot; I asked 
<br>him if he believed his wife wanted to have sex with him. To this he also replied in the negative.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120284px; width:585px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I told Phil that I thought his lack of sex was symptomatic of a bigger problem in his life â him not 
<br>thinking his needs were important and not believing that other people wanted to help him meet his 
<br>needs. I suggested that changing his beliefs about his sexual needs might be the place to begin changing 
<br>core beliefs that prevented him from having other things he wanted in life.

<br>shared in his enthusiasm. They wanted to know how it happened. &quot;I asked,&quot; was Phil&#x27;s simple reply. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120535px; width:580px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">I questioned Phil how his wife felt about having sex with him. &quot;She was fine about it,&quot; he replied. &quot;She 
<br>said she likes having sex with me, but that I hadn&#x27;t asked in a long time so she didn&#x27;t think I was 
<br>interested.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120605px; width:586px; height:97px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">A week later, Phil told the group he was dreading asking his father-in-law to borrow money to get the 
<br>old single-pane windows replaced on his house. Some of the group members began asking questions 
<br>about the cost. Some shared that they had done that kind of project before. I suggested that Phil ask the 
<br>group to help him. It was like pulling teeth, but Phil asked the men if they would help him replace his 
<br>windows. The members of the group responded unanimously that they would be glad to. About a month 
<br>later the men got together at Phil&#x27;s house and had the equivalent of an old fashion barn-raising.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120724px; width:586px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">These two experiences had a tremendous impact on Phil. He began to see that his needs were important, 
<br>that people wanted to help him meet his needs, and that the surest way of getting people to help was to 
<br>ask.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120794px; width:573px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Phil began to build on this new paradigm. Within a few weeks he shared a plan with the group to start 
<br>his own business. A friend of the family had offered to help him get started in his own landscaping 
<br>business. This prospect especially excited him because the seasonal work would allow him to teach 
<br>snowboarding during the winter â a life long dream.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120880px; width:575px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">An old friend offered to be his financial backer. His wife volunteered to look for a job that paid health 
<br>insurance benefits. Men in the group offered to help him write a business plan and set up his 
<br>bookkeeping.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:120949px; width:591px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As long as Phil tried to do everything himself, he struggled to get what he wanted. Once he started 
<br>asking for help and letting people be there for him, his life began to turn around. He is now headed in the 
<br>direction of creating the kind of life and vocation he has always dreamed of.

<br>life. They waste time, they procrastinate, they start things but don&#x27;t finish, they spend too much time 
<br>fixing other people&#x27;s problems, they distract themselves with trivial pursuits, they create chaos, they 
<br>make excuses.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:121630px; width:591px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">Sal is a good example of this. Sal was raised by a passive father and a schizophrenic mother. Neither 
<br>parent was available to pay attention to him or meet his needs. At a young age he had to take 
<br>responsibility for the welfare of his younger brother. Sal had virtually no options as a child. When he felt 
<br>frightened or overwhelmed, he would just hunker down and trudge ahead with dogged determination.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:121716px; width:589px; height:64px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">As an adult, Sal ran a body shop for his uncle. His uncle was a cheap, shortsighted, marginally involved 
<br>business owner. It was Sal&#x27;s job to create a profitable business with the limited resources and dissatisfied 
<br>employees his uncle provided. (Sal actually operated on the assumption that this feat could be 
<br>successfully accomplished!)

<br>quiet the stress headache created by trying to negotiate an impossible situation at work. On one occasion 
<br>I asked Sal if he wanted to explore options for his work situation. &quot;What&#x27;s the use?&quot; he replied. &quot;There&#x27;s 
<br>nothing that can be done.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:121889px; width:583px; height:30px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">For about fifteen minutes, group members asked questions and proposed options.

There is 
<br>no way it could ever happen though. I&#x27;d have to work evenings and weekends. My wife just wouldn&#x27;t go

His eyes reflected a 
<br>terror as if he was being interrogated by Gestapo agents with cattle prods and ice picks. When it became 
<br>apparent that exploring possible options only aggravated his fear and caused him to shut down further, 
<br>the group members mercifully backed off. Later, Sal referred to the experience as &quot;being reamed by the 
<br>group.&quot;
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:10px; top:122636px; width:579px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">In most situations, Nice Guys aren&#x27;t victims to others, </span><span style="font-family: Times-Italic; font-size:14px">they victimize themselves.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px"> By his attitudes and 
<br>actions, Sal all but guaranteed that he would never experience any kind of success or satisfaction in his 
<br>job. It was much more familiar and comfortable to stay stuck in a stressful, no-win situation.

<br>sabotaging himself. This is a crucial aspect in recovery from the Nice Guy Syndrome. In order to start 
<br>getting what they want in life, work, and career, recovering Nice Guys have to make the conscious 
<br>decision to get out of their own way.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:14px">becoming aware of why they unconsciously create so many barriers that keep them feeling stuck. A 
<br>mortgage, a wife, a lack of a degree, debt, children â are all just excuses. Making significant life 
<br>changes doesn&#x27;t require chucking all these things. It means seeing them for what they really are â 
<br>excuses â and taking small steps in the direction one wants to be going.

<br>They tend to see the goodies as being in short supply. They hang on tightly to what they&#x27;ve got, fearing 
<br>there won&#x27;t be more when it is gone. They believe they have to control and manipulate to ensure that 
<br>what little is out there won&#x27;t go away. They play it safe, not trusting that their needs will always be 
<br>abundantly met.

As a successful salesman, 
<br>Russell earned a comfortable six-figure income. He religiously put forty percent of his take home pay 
<br>into savings and investments. He kept a minimum balance of $30,000 in his checking account. In spite 
<br>of his ability to create financial wealth, Russell was controlled by his deprivation thinking. Russell was 
<br>so afraid of financial ruin that he would not allow his wife to buy a $9.00 video for his children at 
<br>Costco if it wasn&#x27;t in the budget.

<br>His father was miserly and rigid. He seemed to single Russell out for critical treatment, while heaping 
<br>praise and favor on his two brothers. Later, before he died, his father cut Russell out of his will and gave 
<br>Russell&#x27;s share to the church. It is no wonder that Russell viewed the world through lenses clouded by 
<br>deprivation.

<br>everyone. Everything we need is flowing by us â all we have to do is get out of the way of our own 
<br>small thinking and let it come.

<br>another.
